MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES.


OLD MOTHER GOOSE.

    OLD Mother Goose, when
      She wanted to wander,
    Would ride through the air
      On a very fine gander.

    Mother Goose had a house,
      'Twas built in a wood,
    Where an owl at the door
      For sentinel stood.

    This is her son Jack,
      A plain-looking lad,
    He is not very good,
      Nor yet very bad.

    She sent him to market,
      A live goose he bought,
    "Here, mother," says he,
      "It will not go for nought."

    Jack's goose and her gander
      Grew very fond,
    They'd both eat together,
      Or swim in one pond.




[Illustration: "SHE SENT HIM TO MARKET, A LIVE GOOSE HE BOUGHT."]


    Jack found one fine morning
      As I have been told,
    His goose had laid him
      An egg of pure gold.

    Jack rode to his mother,
      The news for to tell,
    She called him a good boy
      And said it was well.

    Jack sold his gold egg
      To a rogue of a Jew,
    Who cheated him out of
      The half of his due.

    Then Jack went a-courting
      A lady so gay,
    As fair as the lily,
      And sweet as the May.

    The Jew and the Squire
      Came behind his back,
    And began to belabour
      The sides of poor Jack.

    And then the gold egg
      Was thrown into the sea,

[Illustration]

    When Jack he jumped in,
      And got it back presently.

    The Jew got the goose,
      Which he vowed he would kill,
    Resolving at once
      His pockets to fill.

[Illustration]

    Jack's mother came in,
      And caught the goose soon,
    And mounting its back,
      Flew up to the moon.




[Illustration]


    BOYS and girls, come out to play,
    The moon does shine as bright as day,
      Leave your supper, and leave your sleep,
      And meet your playfellows in the street;
    Come with a whoop, and come with a call,
    And come with a good will, or not at all.
      Up the ladder and down the wall,
      A halfpenny loaf will serve us all.
    You find milk and I'll find flour,
    And we'll have a pudding in half an hour.

THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER.[A]


    THE sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
    He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright--
    And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

    The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
    Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done--
    "It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun!"

    The sea was wet as wet could be,
      The sands were dry as dry.
    You could not see a cloud, because
      No cloud was in the sky:
    No birds were flying overhead--
      There were no birds to fly.

    The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
    They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
    "If this were only cleared away,"
      They said, "it _would_ be grand!"

    "If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year,
    Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
      "That they could get it clear?"
    "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
      And shed a bitter tear.

[Illustration]

    "O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
      The Walrus did beseech.
    "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
      Along the briny beach:
    We cannot do with more than four,
      To give a hand to each."

    The eldest Oyster looked at him,
      But never a word he said:
    The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
      And shook his heavy head--
    Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed.

    But four young Oysters hurried up,
      All eager for the treat:
    Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
      Their shoes were clean and neat--
    And this was odd, because, you know,
      They hadn't any feet.

    Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
    And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more--
    All hopping through the frothy waves,
      And scrambling to the shore.

    The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
    And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low:
    And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row.

    "The time has come," the Walrus said,
      "To talk of many things:
    Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
      Of cabbages--and kings--
    And why the sea is boiling hot--
      And whether pigs have wings."

    "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
      "Before we have our chat;
    For some of us are out of breath,
      And all of us are fat!"
    "No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
      They thanked him much for that.

[Illustration]

    "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
      "Is what we chiefly need:
    Pepper and vinegar besides
      Are very good indeed--
    Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
      We can begin to feed."

    "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
      Turning a little blue.
    "After such kindness, that would be
      A dismal thing to do!"
    "The night is fine," the Walrus said.
      "Do you admire the view?

    "It was so kind of you to come!
      And you are very nice!"
    The Carpenter said nothing but
      "Cut us another slice:
    I wish you were not quite so deaf--
      I've had to ask you twice!"

    "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
      "To play them such a trick,
    After we've brought them out so far,
      And made them trot so quick!"
    The Carpenter said nothing but
      "The butter's spread too thick!"

[Illustration]

    "I weep for you," the Walrus said:
      "I deeply sympathize."
    With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size,
    Holding his pocket-handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes.

    "O Oysters," said the Carpenter,
      "You've had a pleasant run!
    Shall we be trotting home again?"
      But answer there came none--
    And this was scarcely odd, because
      They'd eaten every one.

GOOD KING ARTHUR.


    WHEN good King Arthur ruled this land,
      He was a goodly King;
    He bought three pecks of barley-meal,
      To make a bag-pudding.

    A bag-pudding the King did make,
      And stuffed it well with plums,
    And in it put great lumps of fat,
      As big as my two thumbs.

    The King and Queen did eat thereof,
      And noblemen beside;
    And what they could not eat that night,
      The Queen next morning fried.

WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S-NEST?

    TO-WHIT! to-whit! to-whee!

    Who stole four eggs I laid,
    And the nice nest I made?

[Illustration]

    Not I, said the cow, moo-oo!
    Such a thing I'd never do.

    I would not treat a poor bird so;
    I gave the wool the nest to line,
    But the nest was none of mine.
    Baa! baa! said the sheep; oh, no!
    I wouldn't treat a poor bird so.

THE MARRIAGE OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN.


    IT was on a merry time,
      When Jenny Wren was young,
    So neatly as she danced,
      And so sweetly as she sung,--

    Robin Redbreast lost his heart:
      He was a gallant bird;
    He doffed his hat to Jenny,
      And thus to her he said:

[Illustration]

    "My dearest Jenny Wren,
      If you will but be mine,
    You shall dine on cherry-pie,
      And drink nice currant-wine.

    "I'll dress you like a goldfinch,
      Or like a peacock gay;
    So if you'll have me, Jenny,
      Let us appoint the day."

[Illustration]

    Jenny blushed behind her fan,
      And thus declared her mind:
    "Then let it be to-morrow, Bob,--
      I take your offer kind;

    "Cherry-pie is very good,
      So is currant-wine;
    But I'll wear my russet gown,
      And never dress too fine."

[Illustration]

    Robin rose up early,
      At the break of day;
    He flew to Jenny Wren's house,
      To sing a roundelay.

    He met the Cock and Hen,
      And bade the Cock declare,
    This was his wedding-day
      With Jenny Wren the fair.

    The Cock then blew his horn,
      To let the neighbours know
    This was Robin's wedding-day,
      And they might see the show.

[Illustration]

    At first came Parson Rook,
      With his spectacles and band;
    And one of Mother Hubbard's books
      He held within his hand.

    Then followed him the Lark,
      For he could sweetly sing,
    And he was to be the clerk
      At Cock Robin's wedding.

    He sang of Robin's love
      For Little Jenny Wren;
    And when he came unto the end,
      Then he began again.

    The Goldfinch came on next,
      To give away the Bride;
    The Linnet, being bridesmaid,
      Walked by Jenny's side;

    And as she was a-walking,
      Said, "Upon my word,
    I think that your Cock Robin
      Is a very pretty bird."

    The Blackbird and the Thrush,
      And charming Nightingale,
    Whose sweet "jug" sweetly echoes
      Through every grove and dale;

    The Sparrow and Tomtit,
      And many more, were there;
    All came to see the wedding
      Of Jenny Wren the fair.

    The Bullfinch walked by Robin,
      And thus to him did say,
    "Pray mark, friend Robin Redbreast,
      That Goldfinch dressed so gay:

    "What though her gay apparel
      Becomes her very well,
    Yet Jenny's modest dress and look
      Must bear away the bell."

[Illustration]

    Then came the Bride and Bridegroom;
      Quite plainly was she dressed,
    And blushed so much, her cheeks were
      As red as Robin's breast.

    But Robin cheered her up;
      "My pretty Jen," said he,
    "We're going to be married,
      And happy we shall be."

    "Oh, then," says Parson Rook,
      "Who gives this maid away?"
    "I do," says the Goldfinch,
      "And her fortune I will pay:

    "Here's a bag of grain of many sorts,
      And other things beside:
    Now happy be the bridegroom,
      And happy be the bride!"

    "And will you have her, Robin,
      To be your wedded wife?"
    "Yes, I will," says Robin,
      "And love her all my life!"

    "And you will have him, Jenny,
      Your husband now to be?"
    "Yes, I will," says Jenny,
      "And love him heartily!"

    Then on her finger fair
      Cock Robin put the ring;
    "You're married now," says Parson Rook,
      While the Lark aloud did sing:

    "Happy be the bridegroom,
      And happy be the bride!
    And may not man, nor bird, nor beast,
      This happy pair divide!"

[Illustration]

    The birds were asked to dine,
      Not Jenny's friends alone,
    But every pretty songster
      That had Cock Robin known.

    They had a cherry-pie,
      Besides some currant-wine,
    And every guest brought something,
      That sumptuous they might dine.

    Now they all sat or stood,
      To eat and to drink;
    And every one said what
      He happened to think.

[Illustration]

    They each took a bumper,
      And drank to the pair,
    Cock Robin the bridegroom,
      And Jenny the fair.

    The dinner-things removed,
      They all began to sing;
    And soon they made the place
      Near a mile round to ring.

    The concert it was fine;
      And every bird tried
    Who best should sing for Robin,
      And Jenny Wren the bride.

[Illustration]

    When in came the Cuckoo,
      And made a great rout;
    He caught hold of Jenny,
      And pulled her about.

    Cock Robin was angry,
      And so was the Sparrow,
    Who fetched in a hurry
      His bow and his arrow.

    His aim then he took,
      But he took it not right;
    His skill was not good,
      Or he shot in a fright;

    For the Cuckoo he missed,
      But Cock Robin he killed!--
    And all the birds mourned
      That his blood was so spilled.

    I killed Cock Robin.

    This is the Sparrow,
    With his bow and arrow.

    Who caught his blood?
      I, said the Fish,
      With my little dish,
    I caught his blood.

    This is the Fish,
    That held the dish.

    Who'll make his shroud?

      With my thread and needle,
    I'll make his shroud.

    This is the Beetle,
    With his thread and needle.

[Illustration]

    Who'll dig his grave?
      I, said the Owl,
      With my spade and show'l,
    I'll dig his grave.

    This is the Owl,
    With his spade and show'l.

[Illustration]

    Who'll be the Parson?
      I, said the Rook,

    I'll be the Parson.

    This is the Rook,
    Reading his book.

[Illustration]

    Who'll be the Clerk?
      I, said the Lark,
      If it's not in the dark,
    I'll be the Clerk.

    This is the Lark,
    Saying "Amen" like a clerk.

[Illustration]

    Who'll carry him to the grave?
      I, said the Kite,
      If it's not in the night,
    I'll carry him to the grave.

    This is the Kite,
    About to take flight.

[Illustration]

    Who'll carry the link?
      I, said the Linnet,
      I'll fetch it in a minute,
    I'll carry the link.

    This is the Linnet,
    And a link with fire in it.

[Illustration]

    Who'll be chief mourner?
      I, said the Dove,
      For I mourn for my love,
    I'll be chief mourner.

    This is the Dove,
    Who Cock Robin did love.

[Illustration]

    Who'll sing a psalm?
      I, said the Thrush,
      As she sat in a bush,
    I'll sing a psalm.

    This is the Thrush,
    Singing psalms from a bush.

[Illustration]

    Who'll toll the bell?
      I, said the Bull,
      Because I can pull;
    So, Cock Robin, farewell!

    This is the Bull
    Who the bell-rope did pull.

[Illustration: Poor Cock Robin]

    All the birds of the air
      Fell a-sighing and sobbing,
    When they heard the bell toll
      For Poor Cock Robin.

FREDDIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE.

[Illustration]


    FREDDIE saw some fine ripe cherries
      Hanging on a cherry-tree,
    And he said, "You pretty cherries,
      Will you not come down to me?"

    "Thank you kindly," said a cherry,
      "We would rather stay up here;
    If we ventured down this morning,
      You would eat us up, I fear."

    One, the finest of the cherries,
      Dangled from a slender twig;
    "You are beautiful," said Freddie,
      "Red and ripe, and oh, how big!"

    "Catch me," said the cherry, "catch me,
      Little master, if you can."
    "I would catch you soon," said Freddie,
      "If I were a grown-up man."

    Freddie jumped, and tried to reach it,
      Standing high upon his toes;
    But the cherry bobbed about,
      And laughed, and tickled Freddie's nose.

    "Show me first your penny."
    Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
    "Indeed I have not any."]

    He went to catch a dickey-bird,
      And thought he could not fail,
    Because he'd got a little salt
      To put upon his tail.

[Illustration]

    He went to take a bird's nest,
      Was built upon a bough:
    A branch gave way, and Simon fell
      Into a dirty slough.

[Illustration]

    He went to shoot a wild duck,
      But wild duck flew away;
    Says Simon, "I can't hit him,
      Because he will not stay."

    Simple Simon went a-hunting,
      For to catch a hare,
    He rode an ass about the streets,
      But couldn't find one there.

    Simple Simon went a-fishing
      For to catch a whale;
    All the water he had got
      Was in his mother's pail.

    He went for to eat honey
      Out of the mustard-pot,
    He bit his tongue until he cried,
      That was all the good he got.

    He went to ride a spotted cow,
      That had a little calf,
    She threw him down upon the ground,
      Which made the people laugh.

    Once Simon made a great snowball,
      And brought it in to roast;
    He laid it down before the fire,
      And soon the ball was lost.

    He went to slide upon the ice,
      Before the ice would bear;
    Then he plunged in above his knees,
      Which made poor Simon stare.

[Illustration]

    He washed himself with blacking-ball,
      Because he had no soap;
    Then said unto his mother,
      "I'm a beauty now, I hope."

    Simple Simon went to look
      If plums grew on a thistle;
    He pricked his fingers very much,
      Which made poor Simon whistle.

[Illustration]

    He went for water in a sieve,
      But soon it all ran through;
    And now poor Simple Simon
      Bids you all adieu.

    A FROG he would a-wooing go,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    Whether his mother would let him or no.
            With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
            Heigho, says Anthony Rowley!

    So off he set with his opera hat,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    And on the road he met with a rat.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    "Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    Kind Mrs. Mousey for to see?"
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    When they came to the door of Mousey's hall,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    They gave a loud knock, and they gave a loud call.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    "Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within?"
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    "Oh, yes, kind sirs, I'm sitting to spin."
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

[Illustration]

    "Pray, Mrs. Mouse, will you give us some beer?
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer."
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    "Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    But let it be something that's not very long."
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    "Indeed, Mrs. Mouse," replied the Frog,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    "A cold has made me as hoarse as a hog."
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    "Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog," Mousey said,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    "I'll sing you a song that I have just made."
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    But while they were all a merry-making,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    A cat and her kittens came tumbling in.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    The cat she seized the rat by the crown;
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    The kittens they pulled the little mouse down.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright;
                            Heigho, says Rowley.
    He took up his hat, and he wished them good night.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    But as Froggy was crossing over a brook,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

          With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
          Heigho, says Anthony Rowley!




I SAW A SHIP A-SAILING.


    I SAW a ship a-sailing,
      A-sailing on the sea;
    And, oh! it was all laden
      With pretty things for thee!

    There were comfits in the cabin,
      And apples in the hold;
    The sails were made of silk,
      And the masts were made of gold.

    The four and twenty sailors
      That stood between the decks,
    Were four and twenty white mice,
      With chains about their necks.

    The captain was a duck,
      With a packet on his back;
    And when the ship began to move,
      The captain said, "Quack! quack!"

[Illustration: Music:

    Tom, Tom, was a pi per's son,
    He learn'd to play when he was young;
    But the only tune that he could play,
    Was "Over the hills and far away."

    Tom with his pipe made such a noise,
    That he pleased both the girls and boys;
    They'd dance and skip while he did play,
    "Over the hills and far away."]

[Illustration: Music:

    Tom with his pipe did play with such skill,
    That those who heard him could never keep still;
    As soon as he play'd they began for to dance,
    Even pigs on their hind-legs would after him prance.

    He met Old Dame Trot with a basket of Eggs--
    He used his pipe and she used her legs;
    She danc'd about till her eggs were all broke,
    She began for to fret, but he laugh'd at the joke.

    And as Dolly was milking her cow one day,]

[Illustration: Music:

    Tom took out his pipe and began for to play;
    So Doll and the cow they danc'd a lilt,
    Till the pail fell down and the milk was all spilt.

    Tom saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,
    Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;
    He took out his pipe and he play'd them a tune,
    And the poor donkey's load was lighten'd full soon.]

    THERE was an old woman, as I've heard tell,
    She went to market her eggs for to sell;
    She went to market all on a market day,
    And she fell asleep on the King's highway.

    There came by a pedlar, whose name was Stout,
    He cut her petticoats all round about;
    He cut her petticoats up to the knees,
    Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.

    When the little old woman first did wake,
    She began to shiver and she began to shake;
    She began to wonder, and she began to cry,
    "Lauk a mercy on me, this can't be I!

    But if it be I, as I hope it be,
    I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;
    If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,
    And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail."

    Home went the little woman all in the dark,
    Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;
    He began to bark, so she began to cry,
    "Lauk a mercy on me, this is none of I!"

THE ROBIN REDBREASTS.


    Two Robin Redbreasts built their nests
      Within a hollow tree;
    The hen sat quietly at home,
      The cock sang merrily;
    And all the little young ones said,
      "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee."

    One day (the sun was warm and bright,
      And shining in the sky),
    Cock Robin said, "My little dears,
      'T is time you learn to fly;"
    And all the little young ones said,
      "I'll try, I'll try, I'll try."

    I know a child, and _who she is_
      I'll tell you by-and-by,
    When Mamma says, "Do this," or "that,"
      She says, "What for?" and "Why?"
    She'd be a better child by far
      If she would say "I'll try."

DAME DUCK'S LESSONS TO HER DUCKLINGS.


    OLD MOTHER DUCK has hatched a brood
      Of ducklings, small and callow:
    Their little wings are short, their down
      Is mottled grey and yellow.

    There is a quiet little stream,
      That runs into the moat,
    Where tall green sedges spread their leaves,
      And water-lilies float.

    Close by the margin of the brook
      The old Duck made her nest,
    Of straw, and leaves, and withered grass,
      And down from her own breast.

    And there she sat for four long weeks,
      In rainy days and fine,
    Until the Ducklings all came out--
      Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

    One peeped out from beneath her wing,
      One scrambled on her back:
    "That's very rude," said old Dame Duck,
      "Get off! quack, quack, quack, quack!"

    "'T is close," said Dame Duck, shoving out
      The egg-shells with her bill,
    "Besides, it never suits young ducks
      To keep them sitting still."

    So, rising from her nest, she said,
      "Now, children, look at me:
    A well-bred duck should waddle so,
      From side to side--d'ye see?"

    "Yes," said the little ones, and then
      She went on to explain:
    "A well-bred duck turns in its toes
      As I do--try again."

    "Yes," said the Ducklings, waddling on.
      "That's better," said their mother;
    "But well-bred ducks walk in a row,
      Straight--one behind another."

    "Yes," said the little Ducks again,
      All waddling in a row:
    "Now to the pond," said old Dame Duck--
      Splash, splash! and in they go.

    "Let me swim first," said old Dame Duck,
      "To this side, now to that;
    There, snap at those great brown-winged flies,
      They make young ducklings fat.

    "Now when you reach the poultry-yard,
      The hen-wife, Molly Head,
    Will feed you, with the other fowls,
      On bran and mashed-up bread;

    "The hens will peck and fight, but mind,
      I hope that all of you
    Will gobble up the food as fast
      As well-bred ducks should do.

    "You'd better get into the dish,
      Unless it is too small;
    In that case, I should use my foot,
      And overturn it all."

    The Ducklings did as they were bid,
      And found the plan so good,
    That, from that day, the other fowls
      Got hardly any food.

THE YOUNG LINNETS.


    DID you ever see the nest
      Of Chaffinch or of Linnet,
    When the little downy birds
      Are lying snugly in it,

    Gaping wide their yellow mouths
      For something nice to eat?
    Caterpillar, worm, and grub,
      They reckon dainty meat.

    When the mother-bird returns,
      And finds them still and good,
    She will give them each, by turns,
      A proper share of food.

    She has hopped from spray to spray,
      And peeped with knowing eye
    Into all the folded leaves
      Where caterpillars lie.

    She has searched among the grass,
      And flown from tree to tree,
    Catching gnats and flies, to feed
      Her little family.

    I have seen the Linnets chirp,
      And shake their downy wings:
    They are pleased to see her come,
      And pleased with what she brings.

    But I never saw them look
      Impatient for their food:
    _Somebody_, at dinner-time,
      Is seldom quite so good.

    "Oh, ho!" said the Fox, "it's but a short mile
      From this unto yonder town, heigho!"

    The Fox when he came to the farmer's gate,
    Whom should he see but the farmer's Drake;
    "I love you well for your master's sake,
      And long to be picking your bones, heigho!"

    The grey Goose ran right round the haystack.
    "Oh, ho!" said the Fox, "you are very fat;
    You'll do very well to ride on my back,
      From this into yonder town, heigho!"

    The farmer's wife she jumped out of bed,
    And out of the window she popped her head;
    "Oh, husband! oh, husband! the Geese are all dead,
      For the Fox has been through the town, heigho!"

    The farmer he loaded his pistol with lead,
    And shot the old rogue of a Fox through the head;
    "Ah, ha!" said the farmer, "I think you're quite dead,
      And no more you'll trouble the town, heigho!"

[Illustration: THE TURTLE-DOVE'S NEST.]


    VERY high in the pine-tree,
      The little Turtle-dove
    Made a pretty little nursery,
      To please her little love.
    She was gentle, she was soft,
      And her large dark eye
    Often turned to her mate,
      Who was sitting close by.

    "Coo," said the Turtle-dove,
      "Coo," said she;
    "Oh, I love thee," said the Turtle-dove.
      "And I love THEE."
    In the long shady branches
      Of the dark pine-tree,
    How happy were the Doves
      In their little nursery!

    The young Turtle-doves
      Never quarrelled in the nest;
    For they dearly loved each other,
      Though they loved their mother best.
    "Coo," said the little Doves.
      "Coo," said she.
    And they played together kindly
      In the dark pine-tree.

    In this nursery of yours,
      Little sister, little brother,
    Like the Turtle-dove's nest--
      Do you love one another?
    Are you kind, are you gentle,
      As children ought to be?
    Then the happiest of nests
      Is your own nursery.

THE OLD WOMAN AND HER PIG.

AN old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked
sixpence. "What," said she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I
will go to market, and buy a little pig." As she was coming home, she
came to a stile: the piggy would not go over the stile.

She went a little farther, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog--

    "Dog, dog, bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the dog would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a stick. So she said--

    "Stick, stick, beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile,
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the stick would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a fire. So she said--

    "Fire, fire, burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the fire would not.

She went a little farther, and she met some water. So she said--

[Illustration: "FIRE, FIRE, BURN STICK."]

    "Water, water, quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the water would not.

She went a little farther, and she met an ox. So she said--

    "Ox, ox, drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the ox would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a butcher. So she said--

    "Butcher, butcher, kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;

[Illustration: "BUTCHER, BUTCHER, KILL OX."]

    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Piggy won't get over the stile;
    And I shan't get home to-night."

But the butcher would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a rope. So she said--

    "Rope, rope, hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the rope would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a rat. So she said--

    "Rat, rat, gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;

[Illustration: "RAT, RAT, GNAW ROPE."]

    Water won't quench fire;
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Piggy won't get over the stile;
    And I shan't get home to-night."

But the rat would not. She went a little farther, and she met a cat. So
she said--

    "Cat, cat, kill rat;
     Rat won't gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the cat said to her, "If you will go to yonder cow, and fetch me a
saucer of milk, I will kill the rat." So away went the old woman to the
cow, and said--

[Illustration: "COW, COW, GIVE ME A SAUCER OF MILK."]

    "Cow, cow, give me a saucer of milk;
     Cat won't kill rat;
     Rat won't gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the cow said to her, "If you will go to yonder haymakers, and fetch
me a wisp of hay, I'll give you the milk." So away the old woman went to
the haymakers, and said--

    "Haymakers, give me a wisp of hay;
     Cow won't give me milk;
     Cat won't kill rat;
     Rat won't gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;

[Illustration: "HAYMAKERS, GIVE ME A WISP OF HAY."]

    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Piggy won't get over the stile;
    And I shan't get home to-night."

But the haymakers said to her,--"If you will go to yonder stream, and
fetch us a bucket of water, we'll give you the hay." So away the old
woman went; but when she got to the stream, she found the bucket was
full of holes. So she covered the bottom with pebbles, and then filled
the bucket with water, and away she went back with it to the haymakers;
and they gave her a wisp of hay.

As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old woman the milk;
and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat. As soon as the cat had
lapped up the milk--

    The cat began to kill the rat;
    The rat began to gnaw the rope;
    The rope began to hang the butcher;
    The butcher began to kill the ox;
    The ox began to drink the water;
    The water began to quench the fire;
    The fire began to burn the stick;
    The stick began to beat the dog;
    The dog began to bite the pig;

[Illustration: "THE CAT BEGAN TO KILL THE RAT."]

    The little pig in a fright jumped over the stile;
    And so the old woman got home that night.

[Illustration: "AWAY WENT GILPIN, AND AWAY WENT POSTBOY AT HIS HEELS."]




THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN.

SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED, AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.


    JOHN GILPIN was a citizen
      Of credit and renown,
    A train-band captain eke was he,
      Of famous London town.

    John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
      "Though wedded we have been
    These twice ten tedious years, yet we
      No holiday have seen.

    "To-morrow is our wedding-day,
      And we will then repair
    Unto the "Bell" at Edmonton,
      All in a chaise and pair.

    "My sister, and my sister's child,
      Myself, and children three,
    Will fill the chaise; so you must ride
      On horseback after we."

    He soon replied, "I do admire
      Of womankind but one,
    And you are she, my dearest dear,
      Therefore it shall be done.

    "I am a linendraper bold,
      As all the world doth know,
    And my good friend the calender
      Will lend his horse to go."

    Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said;
      And for that wine is dear,
    We will be furnished with our own,
      Which is both bright and clear."

    John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;
      O'erjoyed was he to find,
    That though on pleasure she was bent,
      She had a frugal mind.

[Illustration]

    The morning came, the chaise was brought,
      But yet was not allowed
    To drive up to the door, lest all
      Should say that she was proud.

    So three doors off the chaise was stayed,
      Where they did all get in;
    Six precious souls, and all agog
      To dash through thick and thin.

    Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
      Were never folks so glad!
    The stones did rattle underneath,
      As if Cheapside were mad.

    John Gilpin at his horse's side
      Seized fast the flowing mane,
    And up he got, in haste to ride,
      But soon came down again.

    For saddletree scarce reached had he,
      His journey to begin,
    When, turning round his head, he saw
      Three customers come in.

    So down he came; for loss of time,
      Although it grieved him sore,
    Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
      Would trouble him much more.

    'Twas long before the customers
      Were suited to their mind,
    When Betty screaming came downstairs,
      "The wine is left behind!"

    "Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
      My leathern belt likewise,
    In which I bear my trusty sword
      When I do exercise."

    Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
      Had two stone bottles found,
    To hold the liquor that she loved,
      And keep it safe and sound.

    Each bottle had a curling ear,
      Through which the belt he drew,
    And hung a bottle on each side,
      To make his balance true.

    Then over all, that he might be
      Equipped from top to toe,
    His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,
      He manfully did throw.

    Now see him mounted once again
      Upon his nimble steed,
    Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
      With caution and good heed.

    But finding soon a smoother road
      Beneath his well-shod feet,
    The snorting beast began to trot,
      Which galled him in his seat.

    "So, fair and softly!" John he cried,
      But John he cried in vain;
    That trot became a gallop soon,
      In spite of curb and rein.

    So stooping down, as needs he must
      Who cannot sit upright,
    He grasped the mane with both his hands,
      And eke with all his might.

    His horse, who never in that sort
      Had handled been before,
    What thing upon his back had got,
      Did wonder more and more.

    Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
      Away went hat and wig;

[Illustration]

    He little dreamt, when he set out,
      Of running such a rig.

    The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
      Like streamer long and gay,
    Till, loop and button failing both,
      At last it flew away.

    Then might all people well discern
      The bottles he had slung;
    A bottle swinging at each side,
      As hath been said or sung.

    The dogs did bark, the children screamed,
      Up flew the windows all;
    And every soul cried out, "Well done!"
      As loud as he could bawl.

    Away went Gilpin--who but he?
      His fame soon spread around:
    "He carries weight! he rides a race!
      'Tis for a thousand pound!"

    And still as fast as he drew near,
      'Twas wonderful to view
    How in a trice the turnpike-men
      Their gates wide open threw.

    And now, as he went bowing down
      His reeking head full low,
    The bottles twain behind his back
      Were shattered at a blow.

    Down ran the wine into the road,
      Most piteous to be seen,
    Which made the horses flanks to smoke
      As they had basted been.

    But still he seemed to carry weight,
      With leathern girdle braced;
    For all might see the bottle-necks
      Still dangling at his waist.

    Thus all through merry Islington
      These gambols he did play,
    Until he came unto the Wash
      Of Edmonton so gay;

    And there he threw the wash about
      On both sides of the way,
    Just like unto a trundling mop,
      Or a wild goose at play.

    At Edmonton his loving wife
      From the balcony spied
    Her tender husband, wondering much
      To see how he did ride.

    "Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house!"
      They all at once did cry;
    "The dinner waits, and we are tired;"
      Said Gilpin--"So am I!"

    But yet his horse was not a whit
      Inclined to tarry there;
    For why?--his owner had a house
      Full ten miles off, at Ware.

    So like an arrow swift he flew,
      Shot by an archer strong;
    So did he fly--which brings me to
      The middle of my song.

    Away went Gilpin out of breath
      And sore against his will,
    Till at his friend the calender's,
      His horse at last stood still.

    The calender, amazed to see
      His neighbour in such trim,
    Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
      And thus accosted him:

[Illustration]

    "What news? what news? your tidings tell;
      Tell me you must and shall--
    Say why bareheaded you are come,
      Or why you come at all?"

    Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
      And loved a timely joke;
    And thus unto the calender
      In merry guise he spoke:

    "I came because your horse would come:
      And, if I well forebode,
    My hat and wig will soon be here,
      They are upon the road."

    The calender, right glad to find
      His friend in merry pin,
    Returned him not a single word,
      But to the house went in;

    Whence straight he came with hat and wig,
      A wig that flowed behind,
    A hat not much the worse for wear,
      Each comely in its kind.

    He held them up, and in his turn
      Thus showed his ready wit,
    "My head is twice as big as yours,
      They therefore needs must fit.

    "But let me scrape the dirt away,
      That hangs upon your face;

[Illustration]

    And stop and eat, for well you may
      Be in a hungry case."

    Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
      And all the world would stare
    If wife should dine at Edmonton,
      And I should dine at Ware."

    So turning to his horse, he said,
      "I am in haste to dine;
    'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
      You shall go back for mine."

    Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!
      For which he paid full dear;
    For while he spake, a braying ass
      Did sing most loud and clear;

    Whereat his horse did snort, as he
      Had heard a lion roar,
    And galloped off with all his might,
      As he had done before.

    Away went Gilpin, and away
      Went Gilpin's hat and wig:
    He lost them sooner than at first,
      For why--they were too big.

    Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
      Her husband posting down
    Into the country far away,
      She pulled out half-a-crown;

[Illustration]

    And thus unto the youth she said
      That drove them to the "Bell,"
    "This shall be yours when you bring back
      My husband safe and well."

    The youth did ride, and soon did meet
      John coming back amain;
    Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
      By catching at his rein;

    But not performing what he meant,
      And gladly would have done,
    The frighted steed he frighted more,
      And made him faster run.

    Away went Gilpin, and away
      Went postboy at his heels,
    The postboy's horse right glad to miss
      The lumbering of the wheels.

    Six gentlemen upon the road,
      Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
    With postboy scampering in the rear,
      They raised the hue and cry.

    "Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!"
      Not one of them was mute;
    And all and each that passed that way
      Did join in the pursuit.

    And now the turnpike-gates again
      Flew open in short space;

[Illustration]

    The toll-men thinking, as before,
      That Gilpin rode a race.

    And so he did, and won it too,
      For he got first to town;
    Nor stopped till where he had got up,
      He did again get down.

    Now let us sing, Long live the King,
      And Gilpin, long live he;
    And when he next doth ride abroad,
      May I be there to see.




[Illustration]


    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!
    Up above the world so high.
    Like a diamond in the sky.

    When the blazing sun is gone,
    When he nothing shines upon,
    Then you show your little light,
    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

    Then the traveller in the dark
    Thanks you for your tiny spark:
    How could he see where to go,
    If you did not twinkle so?

    In the dark blue sky you keep,
    Often through my curtains peep,
    For you never shut your eye,
    Till the sun is in the sky.

    As your bright and tiny spark
    Lights the traveller in the dark,
    Though I know not what you are,
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

    A farmer went trotting upon his grey mare,

    With his daughter behind him so rosy and fair,

A MAN OF WORDS AND NOT OF DEEDS.


    A MAN of words and not of deeds
    Is like a garden full of weeds;
    And when the weeds begin to grow,
    It's like a garden full of snow;
    And when the snow begins to fall,
    It's like a bird upon the wall;
    And when the bird away does fly,
    It's like an eagle in the sky;
    And when the sky begins to roar,
    It's like a lion at the door;
    And when the door begins to crack,
    It's like a stick across your back;
    And when your back begins to smart,
    It's like a penknife in your heart;
    And when your heart begins to bleed,
    You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed.

THE WONDERFUL DERBY RAM.


    AS I was going to Derby all on a market day,

          Upon hay, upon hay, upon hay;
    I met the finest ram, sir, that ever was fed upon hay.

    This ram was fat behind, sir, this ram was fat before;
    This ram was ten yards round, sir; indeed he was no more;
          No more, no more, no more;
    This ram was ten yards round, sir; indeed he was no more.

    The horns that grew on his head, sir, they were so wondrous high,
    As I've been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky;
          The sky, the sky, the sky;
    As I've been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky.

    The tail that grew from his back, sir, was six yards and an ell;
    And it was sent to Derby to toll the market bell;
          The bell, the bell, the bell;
    And it was sent to Derby to toll the market bell.

    My Lady Wind, my Lady Wind,
    Went round about the house, to find
      A chink to get her foot in;
    She tried the keyhole in the door,
    She tried the crevice in the floor,
      And drove the chimney soot in.

    And then one night when it was dark,
    She blew up such a tiny spark,
      That all the house was pothered;
    From it she raised up such a flame
    As flamed away to Belting Lane,
      And White Cross folks were smothered.

    And thus when once, my little dears,
    A whisper reaches itching ears,
      The same will come, you'll find;

LITTLE BO-PEEP.

    Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,

    And bring their tails behind them.]

    Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
      And dreamt she heard them bleating;
    But when she awoke she found it a joke,
      For still they all were fleeting.

[Illustration]

    Then up she took her little crook,
      Determined for to find them;
    She found 'em indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
      For they'd left their tails behind 'em.

[Illustration]

    It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray
      Unto a meadow hard by,
    There she espied their tails, side by side,
      All hung on a tree to dry.

[Illustration]

    Then she heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye,
      And ran o'er hill and dale-o,
    And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,
      To tack to each sheep its tail-o.

    She went to the baker's to buy some bread;
    And when she came home her husband was dead.
    She went to the clerk, to toll the great bell;
    And when she came back, her husband was well.

There seemed to be no rhyme nor reason to which poems began with
smallcaps, (represented in this text version as ALLCAPS), and which did
not. Without a clear pattern to follow, this was retained as printed.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
