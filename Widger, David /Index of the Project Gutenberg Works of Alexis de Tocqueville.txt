THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN FRANCE
BEFORE THE
REVOLUTION OF 1789
AND THE CAUSES WHICH LED TO THAT EVENT
By Alexis De Tocqueville



CONTENTS.
	PAGE
Translator’s Preface to the Second Edition 	[5]
Preliminary Notice 	[9]
BOOK I.
CHAPTER
I. 	Opposing Judgments passed on the French Revolution at its Origin 	1
II. 	The Fundamental and Final Object of the Revolution was not, as
has been supposed, the destruction of Religious Authority and
the weakening of Political Power 	5
III. 	Showing that the French Revolution was a Political Revolution
which followed the course of Religious Revolutions, and for what
Reasons 	9
IV. 	Showing that nearly the whole of Europe had had precisely
the same Institutions, and that these Institutions were everywhere
falling to pieces 	12
V. 	What was the peculiar scope of the French Revolution 	16
BOOK II.
I. 	Why Feudal Rights had become more odious to the People in
France than in any other country 	19
II. 	Showing that Administrative Centralisation is an Institution
anterior in France to the Revolution of 1789, and not the product of
the Revolution or of the Empire, as is commonly said 	28
III. 	Showing that what is now called Administrative Tutelage was an
Institution in France anterior to the Revolution 	36
IV. 	Administrative Jurisdiction and the Immunity of Public Officers
are Institutions of France anterior to the Revolution 	45
V. 	Showing how Centralisation had been able to introduce itself
among the ancient Institutions of France, and to supplant
without destroying them 	50
VI. 	The Administrative Habits of France before the Revolution 	54
VII. 	Of all European Nations France was already that in which the
Metropolis had acquired the greatest preponderance over the
Provinces, and had most completely absorbed the whole Empire 	63
VIII. 	France was the Country in which Men had become the most alike 	67
IX. 	Showing how Men thus similar were more divided than ever into
small Groups, estranged from and indifferent to each other 	71
[4]X. 	The Destruction of Political Liberty and the Estrangement of
Classes were the causes of almost all the disorders which led to
the Dissolution of the Old Society of France 	84
XI. 	Of the Species of Liberty which existed under the Old Monarchy,
and of the Influence of that Liberty on the Revolution 	94
XII. 	Showing that the Condition of the French Peasantry,
notwithstanding the progress of Civilisation, was sometimes worse in
the Eighteenth Century than it had been in the Thirteenth 	105
XIII. 	Showing that towards the Middle of the Eighteenth Century Men
of Letters became the leading Political Men of France, and of
the effects of this occurrence 	119
XIV. 	Showing how Irreligion had become a general and dominant
passion amongst the French of the Eighteenth Century, and
what influence this fact had on the character of the Revolution 	128
XV. 	That the French aimed at Reform before Liberty 	136
XVI. 	Showing that the Reign of Louis XVI. was the most prosperous
epoch of the old French Monarchy, and how this very prosperity
accelerated the Revolution 	146
XVII. 	Showing that the French People were excited to revolt by the
means taken to relieve them 	155
XVIII. 	Concerning some practices by which the Government completed the
Revolutionary Education of the People of France 	162
XIX. 	Showing that a great Administrative Revolution had preceded the
Political Revolution, and what were the consequences it
produced 	166
XX. 	Showing that the Revolution proceeded naturally from the existing
State of France 	175
SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER.
On the Pays d’États, and especially on the Constitutions of Languedoc 	182
BOOK III.
I. 	Of the violent and undefined Agitation of the Human Mind at the
moment when the French Revolution broke out 	192
II. 	How this vague perturbation of the Human Mind suddenly became
in France a positive passion, and what form this passion at first
assumed 	201
III. 	How the Parliaments of France, following precedent, overthrew the
Monarchy 	205
IV. 	The Parliaments discover that they have lost all Authority, just
when they thought themselves masters of the Kingdom 	224
V. 	Absolute Power being subdued, the true spirit of the Revolution
forthwith became manifest 	229
VI. 	The preparation of the instructions to the Members of the
States-General drove the conception of a Radical Revolution home
to the mind of the People 	240
VII. 	How, on the Eve of the Convocation of the National Assembly, the
mind of the Nation was more enlarged, and its spirit raised 	243

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
