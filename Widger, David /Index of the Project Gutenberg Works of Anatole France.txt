THE REVOLT OF THE ANGELS
By Anatole France
A Translation By Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson
CHAPTER I	Containing in a few lines the history of a French family from 1789 to the present day
CHAPTER II	Wherein useful information will be found concerning a library where strange things will shortly come to pass
CHAPTER III	Wherein the mystery begins
CHAPTER IV	Which in its forceful brevity projects us to the limits of the actual world
CHAPTER V	Wherein everything seems strange because everything is logical
CHAPTER VI	Wherein P�re sariette discovers his missing treasures
CHAPTER VII	Of a somewhat lively interest, whereof the moral will, I hope, appeal greatly to my readers
CHAPTER VIII	Which speaks of love, a subject which always gives pleasure, for a tale without love is like beef without mustard: an insipid dish
CHAPTER IX	Wherein it is shown that, as an ancient Greek poet said, "nothing is sweeter than Aphrodite the Golden"
CHAPTER X	Which far surpasses in audacity the imaginative flights of Dante and Milton
CHAPTER XI	Recounts in what manner the angel, attired in the cast-off garments of a suicide, leaves the youthful Maurice without a heavenly guardian
CHAPTER XII	Wherein it is set forth how the angel Mirar, when bearing grace and consolation to those dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Champs �lys�es in Paris, beheld a music-hall singer named Bouchotte and fell in love with her
CHAPTER XIII	Wherein we hear the beautiful archangel Zita unfold her lofty designs and are shown the wings of mirar, all moth-eaten, in a cupboard
CHAPTER XIV	Which reveals the cherub toiling for the welfare of humanity and concludes in an entirely novel manner with the miracle of the flute
CHAPTER XV	Wherein we see young Maurice bewailing the loss of his guardian angel, even in his mistress's arms, and wherein we hear the Abb� Patouille reject as vain and illusory all notions of a new rebellion of the angels
CHAPTER XVI	Wherein Mira the seeress, Z�phyrine, and the fatal Am�d�e are successively brought upon the scene, and wherein the notion of Euripides that those whom Zeus wishes to crush he first makes mad, is illustrated by the terrible example of Monsieur Sariette
CHAPTER XVII	Wherein we learn that Sophar, no less eager for gold than mammon, looked upon his heavenly home less favourably than upon France, a country blessed with a savings bank and loan departments, and wherein we see, yet once again, that whoso is possessed of this world's goods fears the evil effects of any change
CHAPTER XVIII	Wherein is begun the gardener's story, in the course of which we shall see the destiny of the world unfolded in a discourse as broad and magnificent in its views as Bossuet's discourse on the history of the universe is narrow and dismal
CHAPTER XIX	The gardener's story, continued
CHAPTER XX	The gardener's story, continued
CHAPTER XXI	The gardener's story, concluded
CHAPTER XXII	Wherein we are shown the interior of a bric-a-brac shop, and see how P�re Guinardon's guilty happiness is marred by the jealousy of a love-lorn dame
CHAPTER XXIII	Wherein we are permitted to observe the admirable character of Bouchotte, who resists violence but yields to love. After that let no one call the author a misogynist
CHAPTER XXIV	Containing an account of the vicissitudes that befel the "Lucretius" of the Prior de Vend�me
CHAPTER XXV	Wherein Maurice finds his angel again
CHAPTER XXVI	The Conclave
CHAPTER XXVII	Wherein we shall see revealed a dark and secret mystery and learn how it comes about that empires are often hurled against empires, and ruin falls alike upon the victors and the vanquished; and the wise reader (if such there be-which I doubt) will meditate upon this important utterance: "a war is a matter of business"
CHAPTER XXVIII	Which treats of a painful domestic scene
CHAPTER XXIX	Wherein we see how the angel, having become a man, behaves like a man, coveting another's wife and betraying his friend. in this chapter the correctness of young d'Esparvieu's conduct will be made manifest
CHAPTER XXX	Which treats of an affair of honour, and which will afford the reader an opportunity of judging whether, as arcade affirms, the experience of our faults makes better men and women of us
CHAPTER XXXI	Wherein we are led to marvel at the readiness with which an honest man of timid and gentle nature can commit a horrible crime
CHAPTER XXXII	Which describes how Nectaire's flute was heard in the tavern of Clodomir
CHAPTER XXXIII	How a dreadful crime plunges Paris into a state of terror
CHAPTER XXXIV	Which contains an account of the arrest of Bouchotte and Maurice, of the disaster which befell the d'Esparvieu library, and of the departure of the angels
CHAPTER XXXV	And last, wherein the sublime dream of Satan is unfolded

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
