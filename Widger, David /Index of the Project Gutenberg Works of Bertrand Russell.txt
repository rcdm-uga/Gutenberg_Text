[11] The subject of causality and induction will be discussed again in Lecture VIII.
[12] See the translation by H. S. Macran, Hegel's Doctrine of Formal Logic, Oxford, 1912. Hegel's argument in this portion of his �Logic� depends throughout upon confusing the �is� of predication, as in �Socrates is mortal,� with the �is� of identity, as in �Socrates is the philosopher who drank the hemlock.� Owing to this confusion, he thinks that �Socrates� and �mortal� must be identical. Seeing that they are different, he does not infer, as others would, that there is a mistake somewhere, but that they exhibit �identity in difference.� Again, Socrates is particular, �mortal� is universal. Therefore, he says, since Socrates is mortal, it follows that the particular is the universal�taking the �is� to be throughout expressive of identity. But to say �the particular is the universal� is self-contradictory. Again Hegel does not suspect a mistake but proceeds to synthesise particular and universal in the individual, or concrete universal. This is an example of how, for want of care at the start, vast and imposing systems of philosophy are built upon stupid and trivial confusions, which, but for the almost incredible fact that they are unintentional, one would be tempted to characterise as puns.
[13] Cf. Couturat, La Logique de Leibniz, pp. 361, 386.
[14] It was often recognised that there was some difference between them, but it was not recognised that the difference is fundamental, and of very great importance.
[15] Encyclop�dia of the Philosophical Sciences, vol. i. p. 97.
[16] This perhaps requires modification in order to include such facts as beliefs and wishes, since such facts apparently contain propositions as components. Such facts, though not strictly atomic, must be supposed included if the statement in the text is to be true.
[17] The assumptions made concerning time-relations in the above are as follows:�
[18] The above paradox is essentially the same as Zeno's argument of the stadium which will be considered in our next lecture.

[22] In what concerns the early Greek philosophers, my knowledge is largely derived from Burnet's valuable work, Early Greek Philosophy (2nd ed., London, 1908). I have also been greatly assisted by Mr D. S. Robertson of Trinity College, who has supplied the deficiencies of my knowledge of Greek, and brought important references to my notice.
[23] Cf. Aristotle, Metaphysics, M. 6, 1080b, 18 sqq., and 1083b, 8 sqq.
[24] There is some reason to think that the Pythagoreans distinguished between discrete and continuous quantity. G. J. Allman, in his Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid, says (p. 23): �The Pythagoreans made a fourfold division of mathematical science, attributing one of its parts to the how many, t? p?s??, and the other to the how much, t? p??????; and they assigned to each of these parts a twofold division. For they said that discrete quantity, or the how many, either subsists by itself or must be considered with relation to some other; but that continued quantity, or the how much, is either stable or in motion. Hence they affirmed that arithmetic contemplates that discrete quantity which subsists by itself, but music that which is related to another; and that geometry considers continued quantity so far as it is immovable; but astronomy (t?? sfa??????) contemplates continued quantity so far as it is of a self-motive nature. (Proclus, ed. Friedlein, p. 35. As to the distinction between t? p??????, continuous, and t? p?s??, discrete quantity, see Iambl., in Nicomachi Geraseni Arithmeticam introductionem, ed. Tennulius, p. 148.)� Cf. p. 48.
[25] Referred to by Burnet, op. cit., p. 120.
[26] iv., 6. 213b, 22; H. Ritter and L. Preller, Historia Philosophi� Gr�c�, 8th ed., Gotha, 1898, p. 75 (this work will be referred to in future as �R. P.�).
[27] The Pythagorean proof is roughly as follows. If possible, let the ratio of the diagonal to the side of a square be m/n, where m and n are whole numbers having no common factor. Then we must have m2 = 2n2. Now the square of an odd number is odd, but m2, being equal to 2n2, is even. Hence m must be even. But the square of an even number divides by 4, therefore n2, which is half of m2, must be even. Therefore n must be even. But, since m is even, and m and n have no common factor, n must be odd. Thus n must be both odd and even, which is impossible; and therefore the diagonal and the side cannot have a rational ratio.
[28] In regard to Zeno and the Pythagoreans, I have derived much valuable information and criticism from Mr P. E. B. Jourdain.
[29] So Plato makes Zeno say in the Parmenides, apropos of his philosophy as a whole; and all internal and external evidence supports this view.
[30] �With Parmenides,� Hegel says, �philosophising proper began.� Werke (edition of 1840), vol. xiii. p. 274.
[31] Parmenides, 128 A�D.
[32] This interpretation is combated by Milhaud, Les philosophes-g�om�tres de la Gr�ce, p. 140 n., but his reasons do not seem to me convincing. All the interpretations in what follows are open to question, but all have the support of reputable authorities.

[34] Cf. Gaston Milhaud, Les philosophes-g�om�tres de la Gr�ce, p. 140 n.; Paul Tannery, Pour l'histoire de la science hell�ne, p. 249; Burnet, op. cit., p. 362.
[35] Cf. R. K. Gaye, �On Aristotle, Physics, Z ix.� Journal of Philology, vol. xxxi., esp. p. 111. Also Moritz Cantor, Vorlesungen �ber Geschichte der Mathematik, 1st ed., vol. i., 1880, p. 168, who, however, subsequently adopted Paul Tannery's opinion, Vorlesungen, 3rd ed. (vol. i. p. 200).

[40] Op. cit., p. 367.
[41] Aristotle's words are: �The first is the one on the non-existence of motion on the ground that what is moved must always attain the middle point sooner than the end-point, on which we gave our opinion in the earlier part of our discourse.� Phys., vi. 9. 939B (R.P. 136). Aristotle seems to refer to Phys., vi. 2. 223AB [R.P. 136A]: �All space is continuous, for time and space are divided into the same and equal divisions�. Wherefore also Zeno's argument is fallacious, that it is impossible to go through an infinite collection or to touch an infinite collection one by one in a finite time. For there are two senses in which the term �infinite� is applied both to length and to time, and in fact to all continuous things, either in regard to divisibility, or in regard to the ends. Now it is not possible to touch things infinite in regard to number in a finite time, but it is possible to touch things infinite in regard to divisibility: for time itself also is infinite in this sense. So that in fact we go through an infinite, [space] in an infinite [time] and not in a finite [time], and we touch infinite things with infinite things, not with finite things.� Philoponus, a sixth-century commentator (R.P. 136A, Exc. Paris Philop. in Arist. Phys., 803, 2. Vit.), gives the following illustration: �For if a thing were moved the space of a cubit in one hour, since in every space there are an infinite number of points, the thing moved must needs touch all the points of the space: it will then go through an infinite collection in a finite time, which is impossible.�

AN ESSAY ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF GEOMETRY
By Bertrand A. W. Russell
Fellow Of Trinity College, Cambridge
1897
CONTENTS
	INTRODUCTION.
	OUR PROBLEM DEFINED BY ITS RELATIONS TO LOGIC, PSYCHOLOGY AND MATHEMATICS.
		PAGE
1. 	The problem first received a modern form through Kant, who connected the � priori with the subjective 	1
2. 	A mental state is subjective, for Psychology, when its immediate cause does not lie in the outer world 	2
3. 	A piece of knowledge is � priori, for Epistemology, when without it knowledge would be impossible 	2
4. 	The subjective and the � priori belong respectively to Psychology and to Epistemology. The latter alone will be investigated in this essay 	3
5. 	My test of the � priori will be purely logical: what knowledge is necessary for experience? 	3
6. 	But since the necessary is hypothetical, we must include, in the � priori, the ground of necessity 	4
7. 	This may be the essential postulate of our science, or the element, in the subject-matter, which is necessary to experience; 	4
8. 	Which, however, are both at bottom the same ground 	5
9. 	Forecast of the work 	5

	CHAPTER I.
	A SHORT HISTORY OF METAGEOMETRY.
10. 	Metageometry began by rejecting the axiom of parallels 	7
11. 	Its history may be divided into three periods: the synthetic, the metrical and the projective 	7
12. 	The first period was inaugurated by Gauss, 	10
[viii] 13. 	Whose suggestions were developed independently by Lobatchewsky 	10
14. 	And Bolyai 	11
15. 	The purpose of all three was to show that the axiom of parallels could not be deduced from the others, since its denial did not lead to contradictions 	12
16. 	The second period had a more philosophical aim, and was inspired chiefly by Gauss and Herbart 	13
17. 	The first work of this period, that of Riemann, invented two new conceptions: 	14
18. 	The first, that of a manifold, is a class-conception, containing space as a species, 	14
19. 	And defined as such that its determinations form a collection of magnitudes 	15
20. 	The second, the measure of curvature of a manifold, grew out of curvature in curves and surfaces 	16
21. 	By means of Gauss's analytical formula for the curvature of surfaces, 	19
22. 	Which enables us to define a constant measure of curvature of a three-dimensional space without reference to a fourth dimension 	20
23. 	The main result of Riemann's mathematical work was to show that, if magnitudes are independent of place, the measure of curvature of space must be constant 	21
24. 	Helmholtz, who was more of a philosopher than a mathematician, 	22
25. 	Gave a new but incorrect formulation of the essential axioms, 	23
26. 	And deduced the quadratic formula for the infinitesimal arc, which Riemann had assumed 	24
27. 	Beltrami gave Lobatchewsky's planimetry a Euclidean interpretation, 	25
28. 	Which is analogous to Cayley's theory of distance; 	26
29. 	And dealt with n-dimensional spaces of constant negative curvature 	27
30. 	The third period abandons the metrical methods of the second, and extrudes the notion of spatial quantity 	27
31. 	Cayley reduced metrical properties to projective properties, relative to a certain conic or quadric, the Absolute; 	28
32. 	And Klein showed that the Euclidean or non-Euclidean systems result, according to the nature of the Absolute; 	29
33. 	Hence Euclidean space appeared to give rise to all the kinds of Geometry, and the question, which is true, appeared reduced to one of convention 	30
34. 	But this view is due to a confusion as to the nature of the coordinates employed 	30
[ix] 35. 	Projective coordinates have been regarded as dependent on distance, and thus really metrical 	31
36. 	But this is not the case, since anharmonic ratio can be projectively defined 	32
37. 	Projective coordinates, being purely descriptive, can give no information as to metrical properties, and the reduction of metrical to projective properties is purely technical 	33
38. 	The true connection of Cayley's measure of distance with non-Euclidean Geometry is that suggested by Beltrami's Saggio, and worked out by Sir R. Ball, 	36
39. 	Which provides a Euclidean equivalent for every non-Euclidean proposition, and so removes the possibility of contradictions in Metageometry 	38
40. 	Klein's elliptic Geometry has not been proved to have a corresponding variety of space 	39
41. 	The geometrical use of imaginaries, of which Cayley demanded a philosophical discussion, 	41
42. 	Has a merely technical validity, 	42
43. 	And is capable of giving geometrical results only when it begins and ends with real points and figures 	45
44. 	We have now seen that projective Geometry is logically prior to metrical Geometry, but cannot supersede it 	46
45. 	Sophus Lie has applied projective methods to Helmholtz's formulation of the axioms, and has shown the axiom of Monodromy to be superfluous 	46
46. 	Metageometry has gradually grown independent of philosophy, but has grown continually more interesting to philosophy 	50
47. 	Metrical Geometry has three indispensable axioms, 	50
48. 	Which we shall find to be not results, but conditions, of measurement, 	51
49. 	And which are nearly equivalent to the three axioms of projective Geometry 	52
50. 	Both sets of axioms are necessitated, not by facts, but by logic 	52

	CHAPTER II.
	CRITICAL ACCOUNT OF SOME PREVIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL THEORIES OF GEOMETRY.
51. 	A criticism of representative modern theories need not begin before Kant 	54
52. 	Kant's doctrine must be taken, in an argument about Geometry, on its purely logical side 	55
[x] 53. 	Kant contends that since Geometry is apodeictic, space must be � priori and subjective, while since space is � priori and subjective, Geometry must be apodeictic 	55
54. 	Metageometry has upset the first line of argument, not the second 	56
55. 	The second may be attacked by criticizing either the distinction of synthetic and analytic judgments, or the first two arguments of the metaphysical deduction of space 	57
56. 	Modern Logic regards every judgment as both synthetic and analytic, 	57
57. 	But leaves the � priori, as that which is presupposed in the possibility of experience 	59
58. 	Kant's first two arguments as to space suffice to prove some form of externality, but not necessarily Euclidean space, a necessary condition of experience 	60
59. 	Among the successors of Kant, Herbart alone advanced the theory of Geometry, by influencing Riemann 	62
60. 	Riemann regarded space as a particular kind of manifold, i.e. wholly quantitatively 	63
61. 	He therefore unduly neglected the qualitative adjectives of space 	64
62. 	His philosophy rests on a vicious disjunction 	65
63. 	His definition of a manifold is obscure, 	66
64. 	And his definition of measurement applies only to space 	67
65. 	Though mathematically invaluable, his view of space as a manifold is philosophically misleading 	69
66. 	Helmholtz attacked Kant both on the mathematical and on the psychological side; 	70
67. 	But his criterion of apriority is changeable and often invalid; 	71
68. 	His proof that non-Euclidean spaces are imaginable is inconclusive; 	72
69. 	And his assertion of the dependence of measurement on rigid bodies, which may be taken in three senses, 	74
70. 	Is wholly false if it means that the axiom of Congruence actually asserts the existence of rigid bodies, 	75
71. 	Is untrue if it means that the necessary reference of geometrical propositions to matter renders pure Geometry empirical, 	76
72. 	And is inadequate to his conclusion if it means, what is true, that actual measurement involves approximately rigid bodies 	78
73. 	Geometry deals with an abstract matter, whose physical properties are disregarded; and Physics must presuppose Geometry 	80
74. 	Erdmann accepted the conclusions of Riemann and Helmholtz, 	81
[xi] 75. 	And regarded the axioms as necessarily successive steps in classifying space as a species of manifold 	82
76. 	His deduction involves four fallacious assumptions, namely: 	82
77. 	That conceptions must be abstracted from a series of instances; 	83
78. 	That all definition is classification; 	83
79. 	That conceptions of magnitude can be applied to space as a whole; 	84
80. 	And that if conceptions of magnitude could be so applied, all the adjectives of space would result from their application 	86
81. 	Erdmann regards Geometry alone as incapable of deciding on the truth of the axiom of Congruence, 	86
82. 	Which he affirms to be empirically proved by Mechanics. 	88
83. 	The variety and inadequacy of Erdmann's tests of apriority 	89
84. 	Invalidate his final conclusions on the theory of Geometry 	90
85. 	Lotze has discussed two questions in the theory of Geometry: 	93
86. 	(1) He regards the possibility of non-Euclidean spaces as suggested by the subjectivity of space, 	93
87. 	And rejects it owing to a mathematical misunderstanding, 	96
88. 	Having missed the most important sense of their possibility, 	96
89. 	Which is that they fulfil the logical conditions to which any form of externality must conform 	97
90. 	(2) He attacks the mathematical procedure of Metageometry 	98
91. 	The attack begins with a question-begging definition of parallels 	99
92. 	Lotze maintains that all apparent departures from Euclid could be physically explained, a view which really makes Euclid empirical 	99
93. 	His criticism of Helmholtz's analogies rests wholly on mathematical mistakes 	101
94. 	His proof that space must have three dimensions rests on neglect of different orders of infinity 	104
95. 	He attacks non-Euclidean spaces on the mistaken ground that they are not homogeneous 	107
96. 	Lotze's objections fall under four heads 	108
97. 	Two other semi-philosophical objections may be urged, 	109
98. 	One of which, the absence of similarity, has been made the basis of attack by Delbouf, 	110
99. 	But does not form a valid ground of objection 	111
100. 	Recent French speculation on the foundations of Geometry has suggested few new views 	112
101. 	All homogeneous spaces are � priori possible, and the decision between them is empirical 	114
 [xii]
	CHAPTER III.
	Section A. the axioms of projective geometry.
102. 	Projective Geometry does not deal with magnitude, and applies to all spaces alike 	117
103. 	It will be found wholly � priori 	117
104. 	Its axioms have not yet been formulated philosophically 	118
105. 	Coordinates, in projective Geometry, are not spatial magnitudes, but convenient names for points 	118
106. 	The possibility of distinguishing various points is an axiom 	119
107. 	The qualitative relations between points, dealt with by projective Geometry, are presupposed by the quantitative treatment 	119
108. 	The only qualitative relation between two points is the straight line, and all straight lines are qualitatively similar 	120
109. 	Hence follows, by extension, the principle of projective transformation 	121
110. 	By which figures qualitatively indistinguishable from a given figure are obtained 	122
111. 	Anharmonic ratio may and must be descriptively defined 	122
112. 	The quadrilateral construction is essential to the projective definition of points, 	123
113. 	And can be projectively defined, 	124
114. 	By the general principle of projective transformation 	126
115. 	The principle of duality is the mathematical form of a philosophical circle, 	127
116. 	Which is an inevitable consequence of the relativity of space, and makes any definition of the point contradictory 	128
117. 	We define the point as that which is spatial, but contains no space, whence other definitions follow 	128
118. 	What is meant by qualitative equivalence in Geometry? 	129
119. 	Two pairs of points on one straight line, or two pairs of straight lines through one point, are qualitatively equivalent 	129
120. 	This explains why four collinear points are needed, to give an intrinsic relation by which the fourth can be descriptively defined when the first three are given 	130
121. 	Any two projectively related figures are qualitatively equivalent, i.e. differ in no non-quantitative conceptual property 	131
122. 	Three axioms are used by projective Geometry, 	132
[xiii] 123. 	And are required for qualitative spatial comparison, 	132
124. 	Which involves the homogeneity, relativity and passivity of space 	133
125. 	The conception of a form of externality, 	134
126. 	Being a creature of the intellect, can be dealt with by pure mathematics 	134
127. 	The resulting doctrine of extension will be, for the moment, hypothetical 	135
128. 	But is rendered assertorical by the necessity, for experience, of some form of externality 	136
129. 	Any such form must be relational 	136
130. 	And homogeneous 	137
131. 	And the relations constituting it must appear infinitely divisible 	137
132. 	It must have a finite integral number of dimensions, 	139
133. 	Owing to its passivity and homogeneity 	140
134. 	And to the systematic unity of the world 	140
135. 	A one-dimensional form alone would not suffice for experience 	141
136. 	Since its elements would be immovably fixed in a series 	142
137. 	Two positions have a relation independent of other positions, 	143
138. 	Since positions are wholly defined by mutually independent relations 	143
139. 	Hence projective Geometry is wholly � priori, 	146
140. 	Though metrical Geometry contains an empirical element 	146
	Section B. the axioms of metrical geometry.
141. 	Metrical Geometry is distinct from projective, but has the same fundamental postulate 	147
142. 	It introduces the new idea of motion, and has three � priori axioms 	148
	I. The Axiom of Free Mobility.
143. 	Measurement requires a criterion of spatial equality 	149
144. 	Which is given by superposition, and involves the axiom of Free Mobility 	150
145. 	The denial of this axiom involves an action of empty space on things 	151
146. 	There is a mathematically possible alternative to the axiom, 	152
147. 	Which, however, is logically and philosophically untenable 	153
148. 	Though Free Mobility is � priori, actual measurement is empirical 	154
[xiv] 149. 	Some objections remain to be answered, concerning� 	154
150. 	(1) The comparison of volumes and of Kant's symmetrical objects 	154
151. 	(2) The measurement of time, where congruence is impossible 	156
152. 	(3) The immediate perception of spatial magnitude; and 	157
153. 	(4) The Geometry of non-congruent surfaces 	158
154. 	Free Mobility includes Helmholtz's Monodromy 	159
155. 	Free Mobility involves the relativity of space 	159
156. 	From which, reciprocally, it can be deduced 	160
157. 	Our axiom is therefore � priori in a double sense 	160
	II. The Axiom of Dimensions.
158. 	Space must have a finite integral number of dimensions 	161
159. 	But the restriction to three is empirical 	162
160. 	The general axiom follows from the relativity of position 	162
161. 	The limitation to three dimensions, unlike most empirical knowledge, is accurate and certain 	163
	III. The Axiom of Distance.
162. 	The axiom of distance corresponds, here, to that of the straight line in projective Geometry 	164
163. 	The possibility of spatial measurement involves a magnitude uniquely determined by two points, 	164
164. 	Since two points must have some relation, and the passivity of space proves this to be independent of external reference 	165
165. 	There can be only one such relation 	166
166. 	This must be measured by a curve joining the two points, 	166
167. 	And the curve must be uniquely determined by the two points 	167
168. 	Spherical Geometry contains an exception to this axiom, 	168
169. 	Which, however, is not quite equivalent to Euclid's 	168
170. 	The exception is due to the fact that two points, in spherical space, may have an external relation unaltered by motion, 	169
171. 	Which, however, being a relation of linear magnitude, presupposes the possibility of linear magnitude 	170
172. 	A relation between two points must be a line joining them 	170
173. 	Conversely, the existence of a unique line between two points can be deduced from the nature of a form of externality, 	171
174. 	And necessarily leads to distance, when quantity is applied to it 	172
[xv] 175. 	Hence the axiom of distance, also, is � priori in a double sense 	172
176. 	No metrical coordinate system can be set up without the straight line 	174
177. 	No axioms besides the above three are necessary to metrical Geometry 	175
178. 	But these three are necessary to the direct measurement of any continuum 	176
179. 	Two philosophical questions remain for a final chapter 	177

	CHAPTER IV.
	PHILOSOPHICAL CONSEQUENCES.
180. 	What is the relation to experience of a form of externality in general? 	178
181. 	This form is the class-conception, containing every possible intuition of externality; and some such intuition is necessary to experience 	178
182. 	What relation does this view bear to Kant's? 	179
183. 	It is less psychological, since it does not discuss whether space is given in sensation, 	180
184. 	And maintains that not only space, but any form of externality which renders experience possible, must be given in sense-perception 	181
185. 	Externality should mean, not externality to the Self, but the mutual externality of presented things 	181
186. 	Would this be unknowable without a given form of externality? 	182
187. 	Bradley has proved that space and time preclude the existence of mere particulars, 	182
188. 	And that knowledge requires the This to be neither simple nor self-subsistent 	183
189. 	To prove that experience requires a form of externality, I assume that all knowledge requires the recognition of identity in difference 	184
190. 	Such recognition involves time 	184
191. 	And some other form giving simultaneous diversity 	185
192. 	The above argument has not deduced sense-perception from the categories, but has shown the former, unless it contains a certain element, to be unintelligible to the latter 	186
193. 	How to account for the realization of this element, is a question for metaphysics 	187
[xvi] 194. 	What are we to do with the contradictions in space? 	188
195. 	Three contradictions will be discussed in what follows 	188
196. 	(1) The antinomy of the Point proves the relativity of space, 	189
197. 	And shows that Geometry must have some reference to matter, 	190
198. 	By which means it is made to refer to spatial order, not to empty space 	191
199. 	The causal properties of matter are irrelevant to Geometry, which must regard it as composed of unextended atoms, by which points are replaced 	191
200. 	(2) The circle in defining straight lines and planes is overcome by the same reference to matter 	192
201. 	(3) The antinomy that space is relational and yet more than relational, 	193
202. 	Seems to depend on the confusion of empty space with spatial order 	193
203. 	Kant regarded empty space as the subject-matter of Geometry, 	194
204. 	But the arguments of the Aesthetic are inconclusive on this point, 	195
205. 	And are upset by the mathematical antinomies, which prove that spatial order should be the subject-matter of Geometry 	196
206. 	The apparent thinghood of space is a psychological illusion, due to the fact that spatial relations are immediately given 	196
207. 	The apparent divisibility of spatial relations is either an illusion, arising out of empty space, or the expression of the possibility of quantitatively different spatial relations 	197
208. 	Externality is not a relation, but an aspect of relations. Spatial order, owing to its reference to matter, is a real relation 	198
209. 	Conclusion 	199

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
