The "Mound-Builders" 140-146
The notion that they were like the Aztecs 142

CHAPTER II.
PRE-COLUMBIAN VOYAGES.

Stories of voyages to America before Columbus; the Chinese 148
The Irish. 149
Blowing and drifting; Cousin, of Dieppe 150
These stories are of small value 150
But the case of the Northmen is quite different 151

Founding of a colony in Iceland, A. D. 874 153
Icelandic literature 154

Northern limit of the vine 181
Length of the winter day 182
Indian corn 182, 183
Winter weather in Vinland 184
Vinland was probably situated somewhere between Cape Breton and Point Judith 185
Further ear-marks of truth; savages and barbarians of the lower status were unknown to mediæval Europeans 185, 186
The natives of Vinland as described in the Icelandic narratives 187-193
Meaning of the epithet "Skrælings" 188, 189
Personal appearance of the Skrælings 189
The Skrælings of Vinland were Indians,—very likely Algonquins 190
The "balista" or "demon's head" 191, 192
The story of the "uniped" 193
Character of the Icelandic records; misleading associations with the word "saga" 194
The comparison between Leif Ericsson and Agamemnon, made by a committee of the Massachusetts Historical Society, was peculiarly unfortunate and inappropriate 194, 197
The story of the Trojan War, in the shape in which we find it in Greek poetry, is pure folk-lore 195
The Saga of Eric the Red is not folk-lore 196
Mythical and historical sagas 197
The western or Hauks-bók version of Eric the Red's Saga 198
The northern or Flateyar-bók version 199
Presumption against sources not contemporary 200

Absurd speculations of zealous antiquarians 213-215

Governor Arnold's stone windmill 215
There is no reason for supposing that the Northmen founded a colony in Vinland 216
No archæological remains of them have been found south of Davis strait 217
If the Northmen had founded a successful colony, they would have introduced domestic cattle into the North American fauna 218
And such animals could not have vanished and left no trace of their existence 219, 220
Further fortunes of the Greenland colony 221
Bishop Eric's voyage in search of Vinland, 1121 222
The ship from Markland, 1347 223

The Zeno map 232, 233
Queer transformations of names 234-236
(p. xxvi) The name Færoislander became Frislanda 236
The narrative nowhere makes a claim to the "discovery of America" 237
The "Zichmni" of the narrative means Henry Sinclair 238
Bardsen's "Description of Greenland" 239
The monastery of St. Olaus and its hot spring 240

Volcanic phenomena in Greenland 242, 243
Estotiland 244
Drogio 245
Inhabitants of Drogio and the countries beyond 246
The Fisherman's return to Frislanda 247
Was the account of Drogio woven into the narrative by the younger Nicolò? 248
Or does it represent actual experiences in North America? 249
The case of David Ingram, 1568 250
The case of Cabeza de Vaca, 1528-36 251
There may have been unrecorded instances of visits to North America 252
The pre-Columbian voyages made no real contributions to geographical knowledge 253
And were in no true sense a discovery of America 254
Real contact between the eastern and western hemisphere was first established by Columbus 255
CHAPTER III.
EUROPE AND CATHAY.

Why the voyages of the Northmen were not followed up 256
Ignorance of their geographical significance 257
Lack of instruments for ocean navigation 257
Condition of Europe in the year 1000 258, 259
It was not such as to favour colonial enterprise 260
The outlook of Europe was toward Asia 261

(p. xxvii) Claudius Ptolemy and his knowledge of the earth 263

Connection between these voyages and the work of Christopher Columbus 334
CHAPTER V.
THE SEARCH FOR THE INDIES.
WESTWARD OR SPANISH ROUTE.

Sources of information concerning the life of Columbus; Las Casas and Ferdinand Columbus 335
The Biblioteca Colombina at Seville 336, 337
Bernaldez and Peter Martyr 338
Letters of Columbus 338
Defects in Ferdinand's information 339, 340
Researches of Henry Harrisse 341
Date of the birth of Columbus; archives of Savona 342
Statement of Bernaldez 343
Columbus's letter of September, 1501 344
The balance of probability is in favour of 1436 345
The family of Domenico Colombo, and its changes of residence 346, 347
Columbus tells us that he was born in the city of Genoa 348
His early years 349-351
Christopher and his brother Bartholomew at Lisbon 351, 352
Philippa Moñiz de Perestrelo 352
Personal appearance of Columbus 353
His marriage, and life upon the island of Porto Santo 353, 354
The king of Portugal asks advice of the great astronomer Toscanelli 355
(p. xxx) Toscanelli's first letter to Columbus 356-361
His second letter to Columbus 361, 362
Who first suggested the feasibleness of a westward route to the Indies? Was it Columbus? 363
Perhaps it was Toscanelli 363, 364
Note on the date of Toscanelli's first letter to Columbus 365-367
The idea, being naturally suggested by the globular form of the earth, was as old as Aristotle 368, 369
Opinions of ancient writers 370
Opinions of Christian writers 371
The "Imago Mundi" of Petrus Alliacus 372, 373
Ancient estimates of the size of the globe and the length of the Œcumene 374
Toscanelli's calculation of the size of the earth, and of the position of Japan (Cipango) 375, 376
Columbus's opinions of the size of the globe, the length of the Œcumene, and the width of the Atlantic ocean from Portugal to Japan 377-380
There was a fortunate mixture of truth and error in these opinions of Columbus 381
The whole point and purport of Columbus's scheme lay in its promise of a route to the Indies shorter than that which the Portuguese were seeking by way of Guinea 381
Columbus's speculations on climate; his voyages to Guinea and into the Arctic ocean 382
He may have reached Jan Mayen island, and stopped at Iceland 383, 384
The Scandinavian hypothesis that Columbus "must have" heard and understood the story of the Vinland voyages 384, 385
It has not a particle of evidence in its favour 385
It is not probable that Columbus knew of Adam of Bremen's allusion to Vinland, or that he would have understood it if he had read it 386
It is doubtful if he would have stumbled upon the story in Iceland 387
If he had heard it, he would probably have classed it with such tales as that of St. Brandan's isle 388
(p. xxxi) He could not possibly have obtained from such a source his opinion of the width of the ocean 388, 389
If he had known and understood the Vinland story, he had the strongest motives for proclaiming it and no motive whatever for concealing it 390-392
No trace of a thought of Vinland appears in any of his voyages 393
Why did not Norway or Iceland utter a protest in 1493? 393
The idea of Vinland was not associated with the idea of America until the seventeenth century 394
Recapitulation of the genesis of Columbus's scheme 395
Martin Behaim's improved astrolabe 395, 396
Negotiations of Columbus with John II. of Portugal 396, 397

Bartholomew Columbus returns from the Cape of Good Hope, December, 1487 402, 403
Christopher visits Bartholomew at Lisbon, cir. September, 1488, and sends him to England 404
Bartholomew, after mishaps, reaches England cir. February, 1490, and goes thence to France before 1492 405-407
The duke of Medina-Celi proposes to furnish the ships for Columbus, but the queen withholds her consent 408, 409
Columbus makes up his mind to get his family together and go to France, October, 1491 409, 410
A change of fortune; he stops at La Rábida, and meets the prior Juan Perez, who writes to the queen 411
Columbus is summoned back to court 411
The junto before Granada, December, 1491 412, 413

THE CRITICAL PERIOD AMERICAN HISTORY
1783–1789
By John Fiske
"I am uneasy and apprehensive, more so than during the war."
Jay to Washington, June 27, 1786.
CONTENTS
CHAPTER I.
RESULTS OF YORKTOWN.
PAGE
Fall of Lord North's ministry	1
Sympathy between British Whigs and the revolutionary party in America	2
It weakened the Whig party in England	3
Character of Lord Shelburne	4
Political instability of the Rockingham ministry	5, 6
Obstacles in the way of a treaty of peace	7, 8
Oswald talks with Franklin	9–11
Grenville has an interview with Vergennes	12
Effects of Rodney's victory	13
Misunderstanding between Fox and Shelburne	14
Fall of the Rockingham ministry	15
Shelburne becomes prime minister	16
Defeat of the Spaniards and French at Gibraltar	17
French policy opposed to American interests	18
The valley of the Mississippi; Aranda's prophecy	19
The Newfoundland fisheries	20
Jay detects the schemes of Vergennes	21
And sends Dr Vaughan to visit Shelburne	22
John Adams arrives in Paris and joins with Jay in insisting upon a separate negotiation with England	23, 24
The separate American treaty, as agreed upon:
1. Boundaries	25
2. Fisheries; commercial intercourse	26
3. Private debts	27
4. Compensation of loyalists	28–32
Secret article relating to the Yazoo boundary	33
Vergennes does not like the way in which it has been done	33
On the part of the Americans it was a great diplomatic victory	34
Which the commissioners won by disregarding the instructions of Congress and acting on their own responsibility	35
The Spanish treaty	36
The French treaty	37
Coalition of Fox with North	38–42
They attack the American treaty in Parliament	43
And compel Shelburne to resign	44
Which leaves England without a government, while for several weeks the king is too angry to appoint ministers	44
Until at length he succumbs to the coalition, which presently adopts and ratifies the American treaty	45
The coalition ministry is wrecked upon Fox's India Bill	46
Constitutional crisis ends in the overwhelming victory of Pitt in the elections of May, 1784	47
And this, although apparently a triumph for the king, was really a death-blow to his system of personal government	48, 49
CHAPTER II.
THE THIRTEEN COMMONWEALTHS.
Cessation of hostilities in America	50
Departure of the British troops	51
Washington resigns his command	52

The next five years were the most critical years in American history	55
Absence of a sentiment of union, and consequent danger of anarchy	56, 57
European statesmen, whether hostile or friendly, had little faith in the stability of the Union	58
False historic analogies	59
Influence of railroad and telegraph upon the perpetuity of the Union	60
Difficulty of travelling a hundred years ago	61
Local jealousies and antipathies, an inheritance from primeval savagery	62, 63
Conservative character of the American Revolution	64
State governments remodelled; assemblies continued from colonial times	65
Origin of the senates in the governor's council of assistants	66
Governors viewed with suspicion	67
Analogies with British institutions	68
The judiciary	69
Restrictions upon suffrage	70
Abolition of primogeniture, entails, and manorial privileges	71
Steps toward the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade	72–75
Progress toward religious freedom	76, 77
Church and state in Virginia	78, 79
Persecution of dissenters	80

Ordination of Samuel Seabury by non-jurors at Aberdeen	84
Francis Asbury and the Methodists	85
Presbyterians and Congregationalists	86
Roman Catholics	87
Except in the instance of slavery, all the changes described in this chapter were favourable to the union of the states	88
But while the state governments, in all these changes, are seen working smoothly, we have next to observe, by contrast, the clumsiness and inefficiency of the federal government	89
CHAPTER III.
THE LEAGUE OF FRIENDSHIP.
The several states have never enjoyed complete sovereignty	90
But in the very act of severing their connection with Great Britain, they entered into some sort of union	91
Anomalous character of the Continental Congress	92
The articles of confederation; they sought to establish a "league of friendship" between the states	93–97
But failed to create a federal government endowed with real sovereignty	98–100
Military weakness of the government	101–103
Extreme difficulty of obtaining a revenue	104, 105
Congress, being unable to pay the army, was afraid of it	106
Supposed scheme for making Washington king	107
Greene's experience in South Carolina	108
Gates's staff officers and the Newburgh address	109
The danger averted by Washington	110, 111
Congress driven from Philadelphia by mutinous soldiers	112
The Commutation Act denounced in New England	113
Order of the Cincinnati	114–117
Reasons for the dread which it inspired	118
Congress finds itself unable to carry out the provisions of the treaty with Great Britain	119
Persecution of the loyalists	120, 121
It was especially severe in New York	122
Trespass Act of 1784 directed against the loyalists	123
Character and early career of Alexander Hamilton	124–126
The case of Rutgers v. Waddington	127, 128
Wholesale emigration of Tories	129, 130
Congress unable to enforce payment of debts to British creditors	131
England retaliates by refusing to surrender the fortresses on the northwestern frontier	132, 133
CHAPTER IV.
DRIFTING TOWARD ANARCHY.
The barbarous superstitions of the Middle Ages concerning trade were still rife in the eighteenth century	134
The old theory of the uses of a colony	135
Pitt's unsuccessful attempt to secure free trade between Great Britain and the United States	136
Ship-building in New England	137
British navigation acts and orders in council directed against American commerce	138
John Adams tried in vain to negotiate a commercial treaty with Great Britain	139, 140
And could see no escape from the difficulties except in systematic reprisal	141
But any such reprisal was impracticable, for the several states imposed conflicting duties	142
Attempts to give Congress the power of regulating commerce were unsuccessful	143, 144
And the several states began to make commercial war upon one another	145
Attempts of New York to oppress New Jersey and Connecticut	146
Retaliatory measures of the two latter states	147
The quarrel between Connecticut and Pennsylvania over the possession of the valley of Wyoming	148–150
The quarrel between New York and New Hampshire over the possession of the Green Mountains	151–153
Failure of American diplomacy because European states could not tell whether they were dealing with one nation or with thirteen	154, 155
Failure of American credit; John Adams begging in Holland	156, 157
The Barbary pirates	158
American citizens kidnapped and sold into slavery	159
Lord Sheffield's outrageous pamphlet	160
Tripoli's demand for blackmail	161
Congress unable to protect American citizens	162
Financial distress after the Revolutionary War	163, 164
State of the coinage	165
Cost of the war in money	166
Robert Morris and his immense services	167
The craze for paper money	168
Agitation in the southern and middle states	169–171
Distress in New England	172

Claims of New York	190

John Sevier and the state of Franklin	200, 201
The northwestern territory	202
Origin of the Ohio company	203
The Ordinance of 1787	204–206
Theory of folkland upon which the ordinance was based	207
Spain, hearing of the secret article in the treaty of 1783, loses her temper and threatens to shut up the Mississippi River	208, 209

The Madison-Tyler motion in the Virginia legislature	215
Convention at Annapolis, Sept 11, 1786	216

The other leading members	228
Washington chosen president of the convention	229
CHAPTER VI.
THE FEDERAL CONVENTION.
Why the proceedings of the convention were kept secret for so many years	230
Difficulty of the problem to be solved	231
Symptoms of cowardice repressed by Washington's impassioned speech	232
The root of all the difficulties; the edicts of the federal government had operated only upon states, not upon individuals, and therefore could not be enforced without danger of war	233–233
The Virginia plan, of which Madison was the chief author, offered a radical cure	236
And was felt to be revolutionary in its character	237–239
Fundamental features of the Virginia plan	240, 241
How it was at first received	242
The House of Representatives must be directly elected by the people	243
Question as to the representation of states brings out the antagonism between large and small states	244
William Paterson presents the New Jersey plan; not a radical cure, but a feeble palliative	245
Straggle between the Virginia and New Jersey plans	246–249
The Connecticut compromise, according to which the national principle is to prevail in the House of Representatives, and the federal principle in the Senate, meets at first with fierce opposition	250, 251
But is at length adopted	252
And proves a decisive victory for Madison and his methods	253
A few irreconcilable members go home in dudgeon	254
But the small states, having been propitiated, are suddenly converted to Federalism, and make the victory complete	255
Vague dread of the future west	255
The struggle between pro-slavery and anti-slavery parties began in the convention, and was quieted by two compromises	256
Should representation be proportioned to wealth or to population?	257
Were slaves to be reckoned as persons or as chattels?	258
Attitude of the Virginia statesmen	259
It was absolutely necessary to satisfy South Carolina	260
The three fifths compromise, suggested by Madison, was a genuine English solution, if ever there was one	261
There was neither rhyme nor reason in it, but for all that, it was the best solution attainable at the time	262
The next compromise was between New England and South Carolina as to the foreign slave-trade and the power of the federal government over commerce	263
George Mason calls the slave-trade an "infernal traffic"	264
And the compromise offends and alarms Virginia	265
Belief in the moribund condition of slavery	266
The foundations of the Constitution were laid in compromise	267
Powers granted to the federal government	268
Use of federal troops in suppressing insurrections	269
Various federal powers	270
Provision for a federal city under federal jurisdiction	271
The Federal Congress might compel the attendance of members	272
Powers denied to the several states	272
Should the federal government he allowed to make its promissory notes a legal tender in payment of debts? powerful speech of Gouverneur Morris	273
Emphatic and unmistakable condemnation of paper money by all the leading delegates	274
The convention refused to grant to the federal government the power of issuing inconvertible paper, but did not think an express prohibition necessary	275
If they could have foreseen some recent judgments of the supreme court, they would doubtless have made the prohibition explicit and absolute	276
Debates as to the federal executive	277
Sherman's suggestion as to the true relation of the executive to the legislature	278
There was to be a single chief magistrate, but how should he be chosen?	279
Objections to an election by Congress	280
Ellsworth and King suggest the device of an electoral college, which is at first rejected	281
But afterwards adopted	282
Provisions for an election by Congress in the case of a failure of choice by the electoral college	283
Provisions for counting the electoral votes	284
It was not intended to leave anything to be decided by the president of the Senate	285
The convention foresaw imaginary dangers, but not the real ones	286
Hamilton's opinion of the electoral scheme	287
How it has actually worked	288
In this part of its work the convention tried to copy from the British Constitution	289
In which they supposed the legislative and executive departments to be distinct and separate	290
Here they were misled by Montesquieu and Blackstone	291
What our government would be if it were really like that of Great Britain	292–294
In the British government the executive department is not separated from the legislative	295
Circumstances which obscured the true aspect of the case a century ago	296–298
The American cabinet is analogous, not to the British cabinet, but to the privy council	299
The federal judiciary, and its remarkable character	300–301
Provisions for amending the Constitution	302
The document is signed by all but three of the delegates	303
And the convention breaks up	304
With a pleasant remark from Franklin	305
CHAPTER VII.
CROWNING THE WORK.
Franklin lays the Constitution before the legislature of Pennsylvania	306
It is submitted to Congress, which refers it to the legislatures of the thirteen states, to be ratified or rejected by the people in conventions	307
First American parties, Federalists and Antifederalists	308, 309
The contest in Pennsylvania	310
How to make a quorum	311
A war of pamphlets and newspaper squibs	312, 313

Rejoicings and mutterings	315
Georgia and Connecticut ratify	316
The outlook in Massachusetts	317, 318
The Massachusetts convention meets	319
And overhauls the Constitution clause by clause	320
On the subject of an army Mr. Nason waxes eloquent	321
The clergymen oppose a religious test	322
And Rev. Samuel West argues on the assumption that all men are not totally depraved	323
Feeling of distrust in the mountain districts	324
Timely speech of a Berkshire farmer	325, 326
Attitude of Samuel Adams	326, 327
Meeting of mechanics at the Green Dragon	327

New Hampshire hesitates, but Maryland ratifies, and all eyes are turned upon South Carolina	332
Objections of Rawlins Lowndes answered by Cotesworth Pinckney	333
South Carolina ratifies the Constitution	334
Important effect upon Virginia, where thoughts of a southern confederacy had been entertained	335, 336
Madison and Marshall prevail in the Virginia convention, and it ratifies the Constitution	337
New Hampshire had ratified four days before	338
Rejoicings at Philadelphia; riots at Providence and Albany	339
The struggle in New York	340
Origin of the "Federalist"	341–343
Hamilton wins the victory, and New York ratifies	344
All serious anxiety is now at an end; the laggard states, North Carolina and Rhode Island	345
First presidential election, January 7, 1789; Washington is unanimously chosen	346
Why Samuel Adams was not selected for vice-president	347
Selection of John Adams	348
Washington's journey to New York, April 16–23	349
His inauguration	350

THE LAND OF THE POWHATANS

young man whose career had been full of adventure	80
Many persons have expressed doubts as to Smith's veracity,
but without good reason	81
Early life of John Smith	82
His adventures on the Mediterranean	83
And in Transylvania	84
How he slew and beheaded three Turks	85
For which Prince Sigismund granted him a coat-of-arms
which was duly entered in the Heralds' College	86
The incident was first told not by Smith but by Sigismund's
secretary Farnese	87
[Pg xiii]
Smith tells us much about himself, but is not a braggart	88

chief's daughter, Pocahontas	103

George Percy's pamphlet	105
The printed text of the "True Relation" is incomplete	105, 106
Reason why the Pocahontas incident was omitted in the
"True Relation"	106, 107
There is no incongruity between the "True Relation" and
the "General History" except this omission	107
But this omission creates a gap in the "True Relation," and
the account in the "General History" is the more intrinsically
probable	108
The rescue was in strict accordance with Indian usage	109
The ensuing ceremonies indicate that the rescue was an ordinary
case of adoption	110
The Powhatan afterward proclaimed Smith a tribal chief	111

importance	111

From infant industries too much must not be expected while
the colonists are suffering for want of food	127

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
