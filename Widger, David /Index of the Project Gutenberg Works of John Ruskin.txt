§  1.	False use of the term "imitation" by many writers on art.	17
§  2.	Real meaning of the term.	18
§  3.	What is requisite to the sense of imitation.	18
§  4.	The pleasure resulting from imitation the most contemptible that can be derived from art.	19
§  5.	Imitation is only of contemptible subjects.	19

§  2.	ideas are to be comprehended under it.	29
§  3.	The exceeding nobility of these ideas.	30
§  4.	Why no subdivision of so extensive a class is necessary.	31
SECTION II., OF POWER.
Chapter I., General Principles respecting Ideas of Power
§  1.	No necessity for detailed study of ideas of imitation.	32
§  2.	Nor for separate study of ideas of power.	32
§  3.	Except under one particular form.	33
§  4.	There are two modes of receiving ideas of power, commonly inconsistent.[Page lv]	33
§  5.	First reason of the inconsistency.	33
§  6.	Second reason for the inconsistency.	34
§  7.	The sensation of power ought not to be sought in imperfect art.	34
§  8.	Instances in pictures of modern artists.	35

§  3.	The second, simplicity.	36
§  4.	The third, mystery.	37
§  5.	The fourth, inadequacy; and the fifth, decision.	37

§  7.	Strangeness an illegitimate source of pleasure in execution.	37
§  8.	Yet even the legitimate sources of pleasure in execution are inconsistent with each other.	38
§  9.	And fondness for ideas of power leads to the adoption of the lowest.	39
§ 10.	Therefore perilous.	40
§ 11.	Recapitulation.	40
Chapter III., Of the Sublime
§  1.	Sublimity is the effect upon the mind of anything above it.	41
§  2.	Burke's theory of the nature of the sublime incorrect, and why.	41
§  3.	Danger is sublime, but not the fear of it.	42
§  4.	The highest beauty is sublime.	42
§  5.	And generally whatever elevates the mind.	42
§  6.	The former division of the subject is therefore sufficient.	42
PART II. OF TRUTH.
SECTION I.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES RESPECTING IDEAS OF TRUTH.
Chapter I., Of Ideas of Truth in their connection with those of Beauty and Relation
§  1.	The two great ends of landscape painting are the representation of facts and thoughts.	44
§  2.	They induce a different choice of material subjects.[Page lvi]	45
§  3.	The first mode of selection apt to produce sameness and repetition.	45
§  4.	The second necessitating variety.	45
§  5.	Yet the first is delightful to all.	46
§  6.	The second only to a few.	46
§  7.	The first necessary to the second.	47
§  8.	The exceeding importance of truth.	48
§  9.	Coldness or want of beauty no sign of truth.	48
§ 10.	How truth may be considered a just criterion of all art.	48
Chapter II., That the Truth of Nature is not to be discerned by the Uneducated Senses
§  1.	The common self-deception of men with respect to their power of discerning truth.	50
§  2.	Men usually see little of what is before their eyes.	51
§  3.	But more or less in proportion to their natural sensibility to what is beautiful.	52
§  4.	Connected with a perfect state of moral feeling.	52
§  5.	And of the intellectual powers.	53
§  6.	How sight depends upon previous knowledge.	54
§  7.	The difficulty increased by the variety of truths in nature.	55
§  8.	We recognize objects by their least important attributes. Compare Part I. Sect. I. Chap. 4.	55
Chapter III., Of the Relative Importance of Truths:—First, that Particular Truths are more important than General Ones.
§  1.	Necessity of determining the relative importance of truths.	58
§  2.	Misapplication of the aphorism: "General truths are more important than particular ones."	58
§  3.	Falseness of this maxim, taken without explanation.	59
§  4.	Generality important in the subject, particularity in the predicate.	59
§  5.	The importance of truths of species is not owing to their generality.	60
§  6.	All truths valuable as they are characteristic.	61
§  7.	Otherwise truths of species are valuable, because beautiful.	61
§  8.	And many truths, valuable if separate, may be objectionable in connection with others.	62
§  9.	Recapitulation.	63
Chapter IV., Of the Relative Importance of Truths:—Secondly, that Rare Truths are more important than Frequent Ones
§  1.	No accidental violation of nature's principles should be represented.	64
§  2.	But the cases in which those principles have been strikingly exemplified.	65
§  3.	Which are comparatively rare.	65
§  4.	All repetition is blamable.	65
§  5.	The duty of the painter is the same as that of a preacher.	66
Chapter V., Of the Relative Importance of Truths:—Thirdly, that Truths of Color are the least important of all Truths
§  1.	Difference between primary and secondary qualities in bodies.	67
§  2.	The first are fully characteristic, the second imperfectly so.	67
§  3.	Color is a secondary quality, therefore less important than form.	68
§  4.	Color no distinction between objects of the same species.	68
§  5.	And different in association from what it is alone.	69
§  6.	It is not certain whether any two people see the same colors in things.	69
§  7.	Form, considered as an element of landscape, includes light and shade.	69
§  8.	Importance of light and shade in expressing the character of bodies, and unimportance of color.	70
§  9.	Recapitulation.	71
Chapter VI. Recapitulation
§  1.	The importance of historical truths.	72
§  2.	Form, as explained by light and shade, the first of all truths. Tone, light, and color, are secondary.	72
§  3.	And deceptive chiaroscuro the lowest of all.	73
Chapter VII., General Application of the Foregoing Principle
§  1.	The different selection of facts consequent on the several aims at imitation or at truth.	74
§  2.	The old masters, as a body, aim only at imitation.	74
§  3.	What truths they gave.	75
§  4.	The principles of selection adopted by modern artists.	76
§  5.	General feeling of Claude, Salvator, and G. Poussin, contrasted with the freedom and vastness of nature.	77
§  6.	Inadequacy of the landscape of Titian and Tintoret.[Page lviii]	78
§  7.	Causes of its want of influence on subsequent schools.	79
§  8.	The value of inferior works of art, how to be estimated.	80
§  9.	Religious landscape of Italy. The admirableness of its completion.	81
§ 10.	Finish, and the want of it, how right—and how wrong.	82
§ 11.	The open skies of the religious schools, how valuable. Mountain drawing of Masaccio. Landscape of the Bellinis and Giorgione.	84
§ 12.	Landscape of Titian and Tintoret.	86
§ 13.	Schools of Florence, Milan, and Bologna.	88
§ 14.	Claude, Salvator, and the Poussins.	89
§ 15.	German and Flemish landscape.	90
§ 16.	The lower Dutch schools.	92
§ 17.	English school, Wilson and Gainsborough.	93

§ 22.	Beauty of mountain foreground.	99
§ 23.	De Wint.	101
§ 24.	Influence of Engraving. J. D. Harding.	101
§ 25.	Samuel Prout. Early painting of architecture, how deficient.	103
§ 26.	Effects of age upon buildings, how far desirable.	104
§ 27.	Effects of light, how necessary to the understanding of detail.	106
§ 28.	Architectural painting of Gentile Bellini and Vittor Carpaccio.	107
§ 29.	And of the Venetians generally.	109
§ 30.	Fresco painting of the Venetian exteriors. Canaletto.	110
§ 31.	Expression of the effects of age on Architecture by S. Prout.	112
§ 32.	His excellent composition and color.	114
§ 33.	Modern architectural painting generally. G. Cattermole.	115
§ 34.	The evil in an archæological point of view of misapplied invention, in architectural subject.	117
§ 35.	Works of David Roberts: their fidelity and grace.	118
§ 36.	Clarkson Stanfield.	121
§ 37.	J. M. W. Turner. Force of national feeling in all great painters.	123
§ 38.	Influence of this feeling on the choice of Landscape subject.	125
§ 39.	Its peculiar manifestation in Turner.	125
§ 40.	The domestic subjects of the Liber Studiorum.	127
§ 41.	Turner's painting of French and Swiss landscape. The latter deficient.	129
§ 42.	His rendering of Italian character still less successful. His large compositions how failing.	130
§ 43.	His views of Italy destroyed by brilliancy and redundant quantity.[Page lix]	133
§ 44.	Changes introduced by him in the received system of art.	133
§ 45.	Difficulties of his later manner. Resultant deficiencies.	134
§ 46.	Reflection of his very recent works.	137
§ 47.	Difficulty of demonstration in such subjects.	139
SECTION II.
OF GENERAL TRUTHS.
Chapter I., Of Truth of Tone
§  1.	Meanings of the word "tone:"—First, the right relation of objects in shadow to the principal light.	140
§  2.	Secondly, the quality of color by which it is felt to owe part of its brightness to the hue of light upon it.	140
§  3.	Difference between tone in its first sense and aerial perspective.	141
§  4.	The pictures of the old masters perfect in relation of middle tints to light.	141
§  5.	And consequently totally false in relation of middle tints to darkness.	141
§  6.	General falsehood of such a system.	143
§  7.	The principle of Turner in this respect.	143
§  8.	Comparison of N. Poussin's "Phocion."	144
§  9.	With Turner's "Mercury and Argus."	145
§ 10.	And with the "Datur Hora Quieti."	145
§ 11.	The second sense of the word "tone."	146
§ 12.	Remarkable difference in this respect between the paintings and drawings of Turner.	146
§ 13.	Not owing to want of power over the material.	146
§ 14.	The two distinct qualities of light to be considered.	147
§ 15.	Falsehoods by which Titian attains the appearance of quality in light.	148
§ 16.	Turner will not use such means.	148
§ 17.	But gains in essential truth by the sacrifice.	148
§ 18.	The second quality of light.	148
§ 19.	The perfection of Cuyp in this respect interfered with by numerous solecisms.	150
§ 20.	Turner is not so perfect in parts—far more so in the whole.	151
§ 21.	The power in Turner of uniting a number of tones.	152
§ 22.	Recapitulation.	153
Chapter II., Of Truth of Color
§  1.	Observations on the color of G. Poussin's La Riccia.	155
§  2.	As compared with the actual scene.	155
§  3.	Turner himself is inferior in brilliancy to nature.	157
§  4.	Impossible colors of Salvator, Titian.	157
§  5.	Poussin, and Claude.	158
§  6.	Turner's translation of colors.	160
§  7.	Notice of effects in which no brilliancy of art can even approach that of reality.	161
§  8.	Reasons for the usual incredulity of the observer with respect to their representation.	162
§  9.	Color of the Napoleon.	163
§ 10.	Necessary discrepancy between the attainable brilliancy of color and light.	164
§ 11.	This discrepancy less in Turner than in other colorists.	165
§ 12.	Its great extent in a landscape attributed to Rubens.	165
§ 13.	Turner scarcely ever uses pure or vivid color.	166
§ 14.	The basis of gray, under all his vivid hues.	167
§ 15.	The variety and fulness even of his most simple tones.	168
§ 16.	Following the infinite and unapproachable variety of nature.	168
§ 17.	His dislike of purple, and fondness for the opposition of yellow and black. The principles of nature in this respect.	169
§ 18.	His early works are false in color.	170
§ 19.	His drawings invariably perfect.	171
§ 20.	The subjection of his system of color to that of chiaroscuro.	171
Chapter III., Of Truth of Chiaroscuro
§  1.	We are not at present to examine particular effects of light.	174
§  2.	And therefore the distinctness of shadows is the chief means of expressing vividness of light.	175
§  3.	Total absence of such distinctness in the works of the Italian school.	175
§  4.	And partial absence in the Dutch.	176
§  5.	The perfection of Turner's works in this respect.	177
§  6.	The effect of his shadows upon the light.	178
§  7.	The distinction holds good between almost all the works of the ancient and modern schools.	179
§  8.	Second great principle of chiaroscuro. Both high light and deep shadow are used in equal quantity, and only in points.	180
§  9.	Neglect or contradiction of this principle by writers on art.	180
§ 10.	And consequent misguiding of the student.	181
§ 11.	The great value of a simple chiaroscuro.	182
§ 12.	The sharp separation of nature's lights from her middle tint.	182
§ 13.	The truth of Turner.	183
Chapter IV., Of Truth of Space:—First, as Dependent on the Focus of the Eye
§  1.	Space is more clearly indicated by the drawing of objects than by their hue.	185
§  2.	It is impossible to see objects at unequal distances distinctly at one moment.	186
§  3.	Especially such as are both comparatively near.	186
§  4.	In painting, therefore, either the foreground or distance must be partially sacrificed.	187
§  5.	Which not being done by the old masters, they could not express space.	187
§  6.	But modern artists have succeeded in fully carrying out this principle.	188
§  7.	Especially of Turner.	189
§  8.	Justification of the want of drawing in Turner's figures.	189
Chapter V., Of Truth of Space:—Secondly, as its Appearance is dependent on the Power of the Eye
§  1.	The peculiar indistinctness dependent on the retirement of objects from the eye.	191
§  2.	Causes confusion, but not annihilation of details.	191
§  3.	Instances in various objects.	192
§  4.	Two great resultant truths; that nature is never distinct, and never vacant.	193
§  5.	Complete violation of both these principles by the old masters. They are either distinct or vacant.	193
§  6.	Instances from Nicholas Poussin.	194
§  7.	From Claude.	194
§  8.	And G. Poussin.	195
§  9.	The imperative necessity, in landscape painting, of fulness and finish.	196
§ 10.	Breadth is not vacancy.	197
§ 11.	The fulness and mystery of Turner's distances.	198
§ 12.	Farther illustrations in architectural drawing.	199
§ 13.	In near objects as well as distances.	199
§ 14.	Vacancy and falsehood of Canaletto.	200
§ 15.	Still greater fulness and finish in landscape foregrounds.	200
§ 16.	Space and size are destroyed alike by distinctness and by vacancy.	202
§ 17.	Swift execution best secures perfection of details.	202
§ 18.	Finish is far more necessary in landscape than in historical subjects.	202
§ 19.	Recapitulation of the section.	203
SECTION III., OF TRUTH OF SKIES
Chapter I., Of the Open Sky.
§  1.	The peculiar adaptation of the sky to the pleasing and teaching of man.	204
§  2.	The carelessness with which its lessons are received.	205
§  3.	The most essential of these lessons are the gentlest.	205
§  4.	Many of our ideas of sky altogether conventional.	205
§  5.	Nature, and essential qualities of the open blue.	206
§  6.	Its connection with clouds.	207
§  7.	Its exceeding depth.	207
§  8.	These qualities are especially given by modern masters.	207
§  9.	And by Claude.	208
§ 10.	Total absence of them in Poussin. Physical errors in his general treatment of open sky.	208
§ 11.	Errors of Cuyp in graduation of color.	209

Produced by David Widger

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
