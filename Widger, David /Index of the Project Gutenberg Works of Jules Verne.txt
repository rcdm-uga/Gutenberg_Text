LIST OF PLATES
"Good," said Glenarvan, "wash the dirty thing and bring it into the cabin." 	p. 13.
The fragments soon strewed the table, and several pieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew them out carefully. 	p. 17.
Dumbarton Castle. 	p. 27.
"Please, madam, speak! I am strong against grief, and can hear all." 	p. 33.
"My father, my poor father!" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan. 	p. 41.
The Rev. Mr. Morton implored the blessing of Heaven, and commended the expedition to the care of Providence. 	p. 52.
This man, tall, lank, and shriveled, might have been forty years old. He resembled a long, broad-headed nail, for his head was large and thick, his forehead high, his nose prominent, his mouth wide, and his chin blunt. 	p. 57.
Paganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was carried away in the rapid flight of imagination. 	p. 65.
They could scarcely see the city, which was on an elevated plain in the form of a terrace, resting on volcanic rocks three hundred feet in height. The appearance of the island through this rainy curtain was misty. 	p. 73.
Peak of Teneriffe. 	p. 74.
Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves. 	p. 81
Port Famine. 	p. 83.
In Concepcion 	p. 86.
The mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful fellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones. 	p. 92.
By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the mountains visible in the distance. 	p. 100.
Two hours more of terrible exertion followed. They kept ascending, in order to reach the highest summit of this part of the mountain. 	p. 108.
The internal rumblings, the din of the avalanche, the crash of the blocks of granite, and the whirlwinds of snow, rendered all communication with each other impossible. 	p. 117.
The bird had raised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least one hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the travelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey. 	p. 125.
A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one of the first ledges of the mountain. This individual had broad shoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs. 	p. 132.
An important road--that from Carmen to Mendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses, sheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and lay bleaching in the sun. 	p. 144.
They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among the tufts of "paja-brava," a kind of grass that serves the Indians as a shelter during the storms. 	p. 149.
"Poor father!" exclaimed Robert; "how he will thank you when you have found him!" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand and pressed it to his lips. 	p. 157.
Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed. 	p. 173.
Arriving within range, Paganel fired a blank charge (for he would not needlessly destroy even a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the geographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses. 	p. 181.
In fact, they were a dozen young children and boys who were drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a striped shirt confined at the waist by a leathern girdle. 	p. 185.
"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman," cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. 	p. 188.
More than once during the journey, the attention and interest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of the mirage. 	p. 193.
"The flood! the flood!" replied Thalcave, spurring his horse towards the north. 	p. 201.
A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives with a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a whirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious tide. 	p. 205.
He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and, shaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly. 	p. 208.
Glenarvan, Paganel, the major, Austin, and Mulready were seated astraddle, or dangling in the branches, according to their own inclinations. 	p. 213.
A long body appeared. Paganel dangled from branch to branch. His hands could grasp nothing. Was he alive, or dead? 	p. 217.
The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders. 	p. 223.
However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate. The dried meat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast sparrows and hilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered. 	p. 225.
They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage. 	p. 229.
The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting perpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in the same place; others spread in zigzag lines, and produced on the dark vault of the heavens astonishing jets of arborescent flame. 	p. 233.
In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu, and enveloped it in its watery folds. 	p. 237.
The sound of a horse's hoofs was heard upon the plain, and the tall form of the Indian emerged from the darkness. 	p. 241.
Glenarvan watched alone. He could not convince himself that the Duncan was so near him; but as for supposing that she had not arrived at her appointed rendezvous, it was impossible, for such a ship there were no delays. 	p. 245.
They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves. 	p. 249.
Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching the ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck they endeavored to count those who were returning. 	p. 252.
"My object," said MacNabb, "is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them." 	p. 257.
At sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan, seemingly separated from all the rest of the rocky group. 	p. 260.
A few hours of their united toil resulted in the death of a large number of seals who were "caught napping." 	p. 261.
Our friends found a few voluntary exiles on the former island, who, by means of seal-fishing, eke out a scanty existence in this out-of-the-way spot. 	p. 264.
Inasmuch as this was sufficient to cook fish, Paganel decided that it was not necessary for him to bathe here "geographically." 	p. 265.
"Major," said Paganel, "will you wager your rifle against my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?" 	p. 268.
"Master Robert shall count for us." And forthwith the learned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of the discovery of Australia. 	p. 269.
Then, impelled by the hurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and the whole deck was swept with tremendous violence. 	p. 276.
"Let go!" cried the young captain. The barrels were inverted, and from their sides streamed floods of oil. 	p. 280.
As the boats containing the whole of the party were rowed ashore, they felt that the fate of their father would soon be probably decided. 	p. 284.
A fair and comfortable locality, which the merry mill crowned with its pointed gable and caressed with the moving shadow of its sails. 	p. 288.
He was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man, of about forty-five. 	p. 292.
"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not two cable-lengths distant." 	p. 293.
When he came to himself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the interior of the country. 	p. 296.
At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a comfortable livelihood. 	p. 297.
This business being settled, the party returned on board. 	p. 305.
The vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning, the whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires. 	p. 308.
Ayrton and Olbinett took their places respectively in front and in the rear part of the cart, while Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, Robert, Captain Mangles, and the two sailors, mounted their horses. 	p. 312.
The "Mosquito Plains," whose very name describes them, and serves to tell of the tortures that our friends had to encounter. 	p. 313.
Red-gum Station, the home and settlement of an emigrant engaged in the cattle-breeding which is the source of so much Australian wealth. 	p. 316.
The major was skillful enough to shoot a very rare bird,--a "jabiru," or giant crane. This creature was five feet high; and its broad, black, sharp conical beak measured eighteen inches in length. 	p. 317.
A crack was heard; the cart inclined at an alarming angle; the water reached the feet of the ladies, and the whole vehicle threatened to give way. It was an anxious moment. 	p. 324.
After dinner the traveling party had, as if in anticipation, seated themselves at the foot of a magnificent banksia; the young moon was rising high into the heavens, lengthening the twilight, and prolonging it into the evening hour. 	p. 325.
"When I am dead, place a pistol in my right hand, and leave me without burial." His forebodings were realized, and the next morning he died. 	p. 328.
He beheld the waters of the Indian Ocean, and proudly unfurled the Australian flag from the topmost branch of the highest tree he could find. 	p. 329.
A terrible accident had occurred, not a collision, but a running off the track and a fall into the river, which was filled with the fragments of cars and locomotives. 	p. 333.
In the midst of the multitude two men were bearing a corpse. It was that of the guard, already cold. A poniard-thrust had pierced him to the heart. 	p. 337.
A boy of eight years, with a notice pinned to the back of his jacket which read as follows: "Toliné, to be conducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid." 	p. 340.
Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and Toliné had to answer many a question. He came out of his examination very creditably. 	p. 341.
In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one. 	p. 344.
Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be seen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold has been found. 	p. 345.
Anon you might see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble and was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical specimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France. 	p. 348.
They were like so many columns exactly mated, and could be counted by hundreds. 	p. 352.
At evening they encamped at the foot of some trees that bore the marks of a recent fire. They formed tall chimneys, as it were, for the flames had hollowed them out internally throughout their entire length. 	p. 353.
Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women, and children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins. 	p. 360.
A sham fight, which lasted about ten minutes, the women urging on the combatants and pretending to mutilate those who fell in the fray. 	p. 361.
Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder, guarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better resist sleep. 	p. 364.
Here, for the first time, they saw the menure, or lyre-bird, whose tail has the form of the graceful instrument of Orpheus. 	p. 368.
It was a charming house of wood and brick, surrounded by clusters of plants, and had the elegant form of a Swiss cottage. 	p. 372.
Of all the sports of the day the most interesting was unquestionably a kangaroo hunt. 	p. 376.
Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. 	p. 380.
Early in the afternoon they passed through a curious forest of ferns. These arborescent plants, in full bloom, measured thirty feet in height. 	p. 384.
Flashes of lightning, the dazzling forerunners of a coming storm, every now and then illumined the horizon. 	p. 385.
He crouched down, and, after a long and attentive observation, distinctly perceived several men. 	p. 388.
But the heavy vehicle did not stir. The clay, now dry, held it as if it had been cemented. 	p. 393.
"If it please your lordship, I will go." 	p. 397.
A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. 	p. 401.
A pair of cassowaries proved that the presence of man did not disturb these peaceful solitudes. 	p. 408.
"Adieu, my lord," said he, in a calm voice, and soon disappeared by a path along the edge of the wood. 	p. 413.
In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the captain bore the body of Mulready. The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and fired. 	p. 420.
The animal reared, Mulready seized his revolver and fired. 	p. 424.
However, the raft was entangled in the midst of the river, half a mile below where they started. 	p. 429.
The two ladies exerted themselves heroically, but their strength was failing every hour. They dragged themselves along, they no longer walked. 	p. 433.
It was a brig of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Macquarie, which traded between the different ports of Australia and New Zealand. 	p. 437.
The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two horses, and they set out. 	p. 441.
But on the next day seven canoes of the islanders attacked it most violently and suddenly, causing it to capsize. 	p. 445.
It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this navigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores. 	p. 447.
Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the chief. 	p. 450.
Day and night, heedless of the torrents of rain and the dashing spray of the sea, he remained on deck. 	p. 452.
The sailor who was steering, and had been forcibly pushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden attack. 	p. 456.
The mainmast went by the board with all its rigging, the brig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to starboard. 	p. 460.
As the Macquarie lay over on her starboard beams, her opposite side was raised, and the defective seams were out of water. 	p. 461.
They therefore anchored, half a cable's length distant, in ten fathoms of water. 	p. 468.
The work was accordingly begun, and considerably advanced when night interrupted them. 	p. 472.
Not long since, in the year 1864, one of these clergymen was seized by the chiefs and hung from the tree. 	p. 473.
The yawl was drawn alongside. 	p. 477.
Night approached. Already the sun's disk was disappearing beneath the horizon. 	p. 480.
The ladies were carried in their companions' arms, and reached the shore without wetting a single fold of their garments. 	p. 481.
While the fire served to dry their garments conversation beguiled the hours, as they lay or stood at ease. 	p. 484.
Louper, with difficulty, managed to support himself on one of them. 	p. 485.
These seals, with rounded heads, upturned look, expressive eyes, presented an appearance, almost a physiognomy, that was mild and wellnigh tender. 	p. 488.
The New Zealand "kiwi," known to naturalists as the apteryx. 	p. 489.
A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It was a canoe seventy feet long and five broad. 	p. 496.
At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen. 	p. 501.
At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo. 	p. 504.
On their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of the heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. 	p. 505.
Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening. 	p. 508.
At last his voice rose above the tumult. "Taboo! taboo!" cried he. 	p. 513.
A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible details. 	p. 519.
The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. 	p. 521.
First her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to the point where the perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope. 	p. 529.
They saw, but were also seen. 	p. 533.
"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you." 	p. 537.
The steward started back in terror. 	p. 545.
The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb. 	p. 552.
An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives. 	p. 553.
On every side water-spouts, with spiral rings of vapor, spirted from the ground like the jets of a fountain. 	p. 560.
A second ball whistled over their heads, and demolished the nearest of the three canoes. 	p. 564.
As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up a well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return on board. 	p. 568.
This sally finished the poor geographer. 	p. 569.
Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs. 	p. 576.
For an hour the two ladies were closeted with the quartermaster, but nothing resulted from this conference. 	p. 580.
He contented himself with shrugging his shoulders, which so increased the rage of the crew, that nothing less than the intervention of the captain and his lordship could restrain them. 	p. 581.
"Do you agree or not?" 	p. 584.
The unfortunate girl arose, and, leaning over the bulwark, would have thrown herself into the sea. 	p. 600.
A man was standing on the beach between two others. His form was tall and stout. 	p. 604.
Harry Grant set his table in the shade, and all took seats around it. 	p. 608.
The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded arms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the vessel. 	p. 613.
Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends. 	p. 617.
Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle. 	p. 619.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
