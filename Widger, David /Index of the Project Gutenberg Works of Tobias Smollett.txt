anecdotes of the family-the mother and daughter rivals-I am guilty of a
mistake that gives me present satisfaction, but is attended with
troublesome consequences

CHAPTER XX I am assaulted and dangerously wounded-Suspect O'Donnell, and
am confirmed in my opinion-concert a scheme of revenge, and put it into
execution-O'Donnell robs his own servant and disappears-make my
addresses to a lady, and am miraculously delivered from her snare

CHAPTER XXI Squire Gawky comes to lodge with my master-is involved in a
troublesome affair, out of which he is extricated by me-he marries my
master's daughter-they conspire against me-I am found guilty of theft,
discharged-deserted by my friends, I hire a room in St. Gile's-where, by
accident, I find the lady to whom I paid my addresses in a miserable
condition-I relieve her

CHAPTER XXII The History of Miss Williams

CHAPTER XXIII Miss Williams interrupted by a bailiff, who carries her to
the Marshalsea-I accompany her-Prove she is not the person named in the
writ-The bailiff is fain to discharge her-We shift our lodging-Her
story, and my reflections thereupon-Progress of a common woman of the
town-Resolves to quit that way of life

CHAPTER XXIV I am reduced to a great misery-assaulted on Tower Hill by a
press-gang, who put me on board a tender-my usage there-my arrival on
board at a man-of-war, where I am put in irons, and released by the good
offices of Mr. Thompson, who recommends me as assistant to the surgeon--
he relates his own story-characters of the captain, surgeon, and first
mate

CHAPTER XXV The behaviour of Mr. Morgan-his pride, displeasure, and
generosity-the economy of our mess described-Thomson's further
friendship-the nature of my duty explained-the situation of the sick

CHAPTER XXVI A disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of
my office-Morgan's nose is offended-a dialogue between him and the
Ship's steward-upon examination, I find more causes of complaint than
one-my hair is cut off-Morgan's cookery-the manner of sleeping on board-
I am waked in the night by a dreadful noise

CHAPTER XXVII I acquire the friendship of the Surgeon, who procures a
warrant for me, and makes me a present of clothes-a battle between a
Midshipman and me-the Surgeon leaves the ship-the Captain comes on board
with another Surgeon-a dialogue between the Captain and Morgan-the sick
are ordered to be brought upon the Quarter-deck and examined-the
consequences of that order-a Madman accuses Morgan, and is set at
liberty by command of the Captain, whom he instantly attacks, and
pummels without mercy

CHAPTER XXVIII The Captain enraged, threatens to put the Madman to death
with his own hand-is diverted from that resolution by the arguments and
persuasion of the first Lieutenant and Surgeon-we set sail for St.
Helen's, join the fleet under the command of Sir C- O-gle, and proceed
for the West Indies-are overtaken by a terrible tempest-my friend Jack
Rattlin has his leg broke by a fall from the mainyard-the behaviour of
Mr. Mackshane-Jack opposes the amputation of his limb, in which he is
seconded by Morgan and me, we undertake the cure and perform it
successfully

CHAPTER XXIX Mackshane's malice-I am taken up and imprisoned for a spy-
Morgan meets with the same fate-Thompson is tampered with to turn
evidence against us-disdains the proposal, and is maltreated for his
integrity-Morgan is released to assist the Surgeon during an engagement
with some French ships-of-war-I remain fettered on the poop, exposed to
the enemy's shot, and grow delirious with fear-am comforted after the
battle by Morgan, who speaks freely of the captain, is overheard by the
sentinel, who informs against him, and again imprisoned-Thompson grows
desperate, and, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me, goes
overboard in the night

CHAPTER XXX We lament the fate of our companion-the Captain offers
Morgan his liberty, which he refuses to accept-we are brought before him
and examined-Morgan is sent back into custody, whither also I am
remanded after a curious trial

CHAPTER XXXI I discover a subornation against me, by means of a quarrel
between two of the evidences; in consequence of which I am set at
liberty, and prevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the same
terms-Mackshane's malice-we arrive at Jamaica, from whence in a short
time we beat up to Hispaniola, in conjunction with the West India
squadron-we take in water, sail again, and arrive at Carthagena-
Reflections on our conduct there

CHAPTER XXXII Our Land Forces being disembarked, erect a fascine
battery-our ship is ordered, with four more, to batter the port of Bocca
Chica-Mackshane's cowardice-the Chaplain's frenzy-honest Rattlin loses
one hand-his heroism and reflections on the battle-Crampley's behaviour
to me during the heat of the Fight

CHAPTER XXXIII A breach being made in the walls, our soldiers give the
assault, and take the place without opposition-our sailors at the same
time, become masters of all the other strengths near Bocca Chica, and
take possession of the harbour-the good consequence of this success-we
move nearer the town-find two forts deserted, and the Channel blocked up
with sunk vessels; which however we find means to clear-land our
soldiers at La Quinta-repulse a body of militia-attack the castle of St.
Lazar, and are forced to retreat with great loss-the remains of our army
are re-embarked-an effort of the Admiral to take the town-the economy of
our expedition described

CHAPTER XXXIV An epidemic Fever rages among us-we abandon our Conquests-
I am seized with Distemper-write a Petition to the Captain, which is
rejected-I am in danger of Suffocation through the Malice of Crampley,
and relieved by a Serjeant-my Fever increases-the Chaplain wants to
confess me-I obtain a favourable Crisis-Morgan's Affection for me
proved-the Behaviour of Mackshane and Crampley towards me-Captain Oakum
is removed into another Ship with his beloved Doctor-our new Captain
described-An Adventure of Morgan

CHAPTER XXXV Captain Whiffle sends for me-his situation described-his
surgeon arrives, prescribes for him, and puts him to bed-a bed is put up
for Mr. Simper contiguous to the state room, which, with other parts of
the captains behaviour, gives the ship's company a very unfavourable
idea of their commander-I am detained in the West Indies by the admiral,
and go on board of the Lizard sloop of war in quality of surgeon's mate,
where I make myself known to the surgeon, who treats me very kindly-I go
on shore, sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and, at my return on
board, am surprised at the sight of Crampley, who is appointed
lieutenant of the sloop-we sail on a cruise-take a prize in which I
arrive at Port Morant under the command of my messmate, with whom I live
in great harmony

CHAPTER XXXVI A strange adventure-in consequence of which I am extremely
happy-Crampley does me in offices with the Captain; but his malice is
defeated by the good-nature and friendship of the surgeon-we return to
Port Royal-our Captain gets the command of a larger ship, and is
succeeded by an old man-Brayl is provided for-we receive orders to sail
for England

CHAPTER XXXVII We depart for Europe-a misunderstanding arises between
the Captain and the Surgeon, through the scandalous aspersions of
Crampley-the Captain dies-Crampley tyrannises over the surgeon, who
falls a Victim for his Cruelty-I am also ill-used-the Ship strikes-the
behaviour of Crampley and the Seamen on that occasion--I get on shore,
challenge the Captain to single combat-am treacherously knocked down,
wounded, and robbed

CHAPTER XXXVIII I get up and crawl into a barn, where I am in danger of
perishing, through the fear of the country people-their inhumanity-I am
succoured by a reputed witch-her story-her advice-she recommends me as a
valet to a single lady, whose character she explains

CHAPTER XXXIX My Reception by that Lady-I become enamoured of Narcissa-
recount the particulars of my last misfortune-acquire the good opinion
of my Mistress-an Account of the young Squire-I am made acquainted with
more particulars of Narcissa's Situation-conceive a mortal hatred
against Sir Timothy-examine my Lady's library and performances-her
extravagant behaviour

CHAPTER XL My mistress is surprised at my learning-communicates her
performances to me-I impart some of mine to her-am mortified at her
faint praise-Narcissa approves of my conduct-I gain an involuntary
conquest over the cookwench and dairymaid-their mutual resentment and
insinuations-the jealousy of their lovers

CHAPTER XLI Narcissa being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy,
is rescued by me, who revenge myself on my rival-I declare my passion,
and retreat to the seaside-am surrounded by smugglers, and carried to
Boulogne-find my Uncle Lieutenant Bowling in great distress, and relieve
him-our conversation

CHAPTER XLII He takes his passage in a cutter for Deal-we are accosted
by a Priest, who proves to be a Scotchman-his profession on friendship-
he is affronted by the Lieutenant, who afterwards appeases him by
submission-my uncle embarks-I am introduced by a Priest to a Capuchin,
in whose company I set out for Paris-the character of my fellow
traveller-on adventure on the road-I am shocked at his behaviour

CHAPTER XLIII We lodge at a House near Amiens, where I am robbed by the
Capuchin, who escapes while I am asleep-I go to Noyons in search of him,
but without Success-make my Condition known to several People, but find
no Relief-grow desperate-find a Company of Soldiers-Enlist in the
Regiment of Picardy-we are ordered into Germany-I find the Fatigues of
the March almost intolerable-Quarrel with my Comrade in a dispute about
Politics-he challenges me to the Field-wounds and disarms me

CHAPTER XLIV In order to be revenged, I learn the Science of Defence-we
join Mareschal Duc de Noailles, are engaged with the Allies of
Dettingen, and put to flight-the behaviour of the French soldiers on
that occasion-I industriously seek another combat with the old Gascon,
and vanquish him in my turn-our regiment is put into Winter Quarters at
Rheims, where I find my friend Strap-our Recognition-he supplies me with
Money, and procures my Discharge-we take a trip to Paris; from whence,
by the way of Flanders, we set out for London; where we safely arrive

CHAPTER XLV I inquire for my Uncle, and understand he is gone to sea-
take Lodgings at Charing Cross-go to the Play, where I meet with an
adventure-Dine at an ordinary-the Guests described-become acquainted
with Medlar and Doctor Wagtail

spend the Evening at a Tavern-our Conversation-the Characters of my new
Companions-the Doctor is roasted-our Issue of our Debauch

CHAPTER XLVII Strap communicates to me a conquest he had made of a
Chandler's Widow-finds himself miserably mistaken-I go to the Opera-
admire Melinda-am cautioned by Banter-go to the Assembly at Hampstead-
dance with that young lady-receive an insolent message from Bragwell,
whose mettle is soon cooled-am in favour with my Mistress, whom I visit
next day, and am bubbled out of eighteen guineas at cards-Strap triumphs
at my success, but is astonished at my expense-Banter comes to my
lodging, is very sarcastic at my expense, and borrows five guineas from
me, as a proof of his friendship

CHAPTER XLVIII We repair to the coffee-house, where we overhear a
curious dispute between Wagtail and Medlar, which is referred to our
decision-the Doctor gives an account of his experiment-Medlar is roasted
by Banter at the ordinary-the old gentleman's advice to me

CHAPTER XLIX I receive a Challenge-the Consequence of it-the Quarrel
being made up, am put in Arrest by the Care and Affection of Strap-but
immediately released upon explaining my Affair-the Behaviour of Mr.
Oregan and his two Friends-I visit Melinda, whom I divert with an
account of the Duel-propose Marriage-she refers the Matter to her
Mother, of whom I make a solemn Demand of her Daughter-the old Lady's
behaviour-I am discarded--resent their Disdain

CHAPTER L I long to be revenged on Melinda-apply to Banter for his
Assistance-he contrives a scheme for that purpose-which is put in
Execution with great Success-I make an Attempt upon the Heart of Miss
Gripewell, but am disappointed-grow melancholy at my Disappointment, and
have recourse to the Bottle-receive a Billet-doux-am ravished with the
Contents-find myself involved in Intrigue, which I imagined would make
my Fortune-am confounded at my mistake, which banishes all Thoughts of
Matrimony

CHAPTER LI I cultivate an Acquaintance with two Noblemen-am introduced
to earl Strutwell-his kind Promise and Invitation-the Behaviour of his
Porter and Lacquey-he receives me with an Appearance of uncommon
Affection-undertakes to speak in my Behalf to the Minister-informs me of
his Success, and wishes me Joy-introduces a Conversation about Petronius
Arbiter-falls in Love with my Watch, which I press upon him-I make a
present of a Diamond Ring to Lord Straddle-impart my good Fortune to
Strap and Banter, who disabuses me, to my utter Mortification

CHAPTER LII I attempt to recover my Watch and Jewel, but to no Purpose-
resolve to revenge myself on Strutwell by my Importunity-am reduced to
my last Guinea-obliged to inform Strap of my Necessity, who is almost
distracted with the News, but nevertheless obliged to pawn my best Sword
for present Subsistence-that small Supply being exhausted, I am almost
stupified with my Misfortunes-go to the Gaming Table by the Advice of
Banter, and come off with unexpected Success-Strap's Ecstacy-Mrs. Gawky
waits upon me, professes Remorse for her Perfidy, and implores my
Assistance-I do myself a Piece of Justice by her Means, and afterwards
reconcile her to her Father

CHAPTER LIII I purchase new Clothes-reprimand Strutwell and Straddle-
Banter proposes another matrimonial Scheme-I accept of his Terms-set out
to Bath in the Stage-coach with the young Lady and her Mother-the
Behaviour of an Officer and Lawyer-our fellow Travellers described-a
smart dialogue between my Mistress and the Captain

CHAPTER LIV Day breaking, I have the Pleasure of viewing the Person of
Miss Snapper, whom I had not seen before-the Soldier is witty upon me-is
offended-talks much of his Valour-is reprimanded by a grave Gentlewoman-
we are alarmed by the cry of Highwaymen-I get out of the Coach, and
stand in my own defence-they ride off without having attacked us-I
pursue them-one of them is thrown from his Horse and taken-I return to
the Coach-am complimented by Miss Snapper-the Captain's Behaviour on
this Occasion-the Prude reproaches me in a Soliloquy-I upbraid her in
the same Manner-the Behaviour of Miss Snapper, at Breakfast, disobliges
me-the Lawyer is witty upon the Officer, who threatens him

CHAPTER LV I resolve to ingratiate myself with the Mother, and am
favoured by accident-the Precise Lady finds her husband, and quit the
Coach-the Captain is disappointed of his dinner-we arrive at Bath-I
accompany Miss Snapper to the Long-room, where she is attacked by beau
Nash, and, turns the Laugh against him-I make love to her, and receive a
check-Squire her to an Assembly, where I am blessed with a Sight of my
dear Narcissa, which discomposes me so much, that Miss Snapper,
observing my disorder, is at pains to discover the Cause-is piqued at
the Occasion, and, in our way home, pays me a sarcastic Compliment-I am
met by Miss Williams, who is the maid and Confidante of Narcissa-she
acquaints me with her Lady's regard for me while under the disguise of a
Servant, and describes the Transports of Narcissa on seeing me at the
Assembly, in the Character of a Gentleman-I am surprised with an Account
of her Aunt's Marriage, and make an Appointment to meet Miss Williams
the next day

CHAPTER LVI I become acquainted with Narcissa's brother, who invites me

to Narcissa-the Squire is introduced to his Lordship, and grows cold
towards me-I learn from my Confidante, that this Nobleman professes
honourable Love to my Mistress, who continues faithful to me,
notwithstanding the scandalous Reports she had heard to my Prejudice-I
am mortified with an Assurance that her whole Fortune depends upon the
Pleasure of her Brother-Mr. Freeman condoles me on the Decline of my
Character, which I vindicate so much to his satisfaction, that he
undertakes to combat Fame on my behalf

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
