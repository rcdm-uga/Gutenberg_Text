The Project Gutenberg Etext of Widger's Quotations from Diary of Pepys
*********This file should be named 4202.txt or 4202.zip*********

This etext was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>

Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of November, 2001, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,

Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin,
and Wyoming.

*In Progress

We have filed in about 45 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

All donations should be made to:

requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fundraising will begin in the additional states.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed

DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, PREFACE AND LIFE  [sp02g10.txt]

Confusion of years in the case of the months of January (etc.)
Else he is a blockhead, and not fitt for that imployment
Fixed that the year should commence in January instead of March
He knew nothing about the navy
He made the great speech of his life, and spoke for three hours
I never designed to be a witness against any man
In perpetual trouble and vexation that need it least
Inoffensive vanity of a man who loved to see himself in the glass
Learned the multiplication table for the first time in  1661
Montaigne is conscious that we are looking over his shoulder
Nothing in it approaching that single page in St. Simon
The present Irish pronunciation of English




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, JAN 1659/60  [sp03g10.txt]

A very fine dinner
Gave him his morning draft
Much troubled with thoughts how to get money
My wife was making of her tarts and larding of her pullets
My wife was very unwilling to let me go forth
Put to a great loss how I should get money to make up my cash
This day I began to put on buckles to my shoes




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, FEB 1659/60  [sp04g10.txt]

Dined with my wife on pease porridge and nothing else
Do press for new oaths to be put upon men
Hanging jack to roast birds on
Kiss my Parliament, instead of "Kiss my [rump]"
Mottoes inscribed on rings was of Roman origin
My wife and I had some high words
Petition against hackney coaches
Playing the fool with the lass of the house
Posies for Rings, Handkerchers and Gloves
Some merry talk with a plain bold maid of the house
To the Swan and drank our morning draft
Wedding for which the posy ring was required
Went to bed with my head not well by my too much drinking to-day




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MAR/APR 1659/60  [sp05g10.txt]

Cavaliers have now the upper hand clear of the Presbyterians
Resolve to have the doing of it himself, or else to hinder it
Strange thing how I am already courted by the people




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MAY 1660  [sp06g10.txt]

An exceeding pretty lass, and right for the sport
And in all this not so much as one
Bought for the love of the binding three books
Drinking of the King's health upon their knees in the streets
Fashionable and black spots
He and I lay in one press bed, there being two more
He is, I perceive, wholly sceptical, as well as I
He that must do the business, or at least that can hinder it
He was fain to lie in the priest's hole a good while
If it should come in print my name maybe at it
In comes Mr. North very sea-sick from shore
John Pickering on board, like an ass, with his feathers
Made to drink, that they might know him not to be a Roundhead
My Lord, who took physic to-day and was in his chamber
Presbyterians against the House of Lords
Protestants as to the Church of Rome are wholly fanatiques





DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, JUN/JUL 1660  [sp07g10.txt]

A good handsome wench I kissed, the first that I have seen
Among all the beauties there, my wife was thought the greatest
An offer of L500 for a Baronet's dignity
Court attendance infinite tedious
Did not like that Clergy should meddle with matters of state
Dined upon six of my pigeons, which my wife has resolved to kill
Five pieces of gold for to do him a small piece of service
God help him, he wants bread.
Had no more manners than to invite me and to let me pay
How the Presbyterians would be angry if they durst
I pray God to make me able to pay for it.
I went to the cook's and got a good joint of meat
King's Proclamation against drinking, swearing, and debauchery
L100 worth of plate for my Lord to give Secretary Nicholas
Most of my time in looking upon Mrs. Butler
My new silk suit, the first that ever I wore in my life
Offer me L500 if I would desist from the Clerk of the Acts place
Sceptic in all things of religion
She had six children by the King
Strange how civil and tractable he was to me
The ceremonies did not please me, they do so overdo them
This afternoon I showed my Lord my accounts, which he passed
To see the bride put to bed
We cannot tell what to do for want of her (the maid)
Where I find the worst very good
Which I did give him some hope of, though I never intend it
Woman that they have a fancy to, to make her husband a cuckold




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, AUG/SEP 1660  [sp08g10.txt]

Boy up to-night for his sister to teach him to put me to bed
Diana did not come according to our agreement
Drink at a bottle beer house in the Strand
Finding my wife's clothes lie carelessly laid up
Formerly say that the King was a bastard and his mother a whore
Hand i' the cap
Hired her to procure this poor soul for him
I fear is not so good as she should be
I was angry with her, which I was troubled for
I was exceeding free in dallying with her, and she not unfree
Ill all this day by reason of the last night's debauch
King do tire all his people that are about him with early rising
Kissed them myself very often with a great deal of mirth
My luck to meet with a sort of drolling workmen on all occasions
Show many the strangest emotions to shift off his drink
Upon the leads gazing upon Diana




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, OCT/NOV/DEC 1660  [sp09g10.txt]

Asleep, while the wench sat mending my breeches by my bedside
Barkley swearing that he and others had lain with her often
But I think I am not bound to discover myself
But we were friends again as we are always
Cure of the King's evil, which he do deny altogether
Duke of York and Mrs. Palmer did talk to one another very wanton
First time I had given her leave to wear a black patch
First time that ever I heard the organs in a cathedral
Gentlewomen did hold up their heads to be kissed by the King
Have her come not as a sister in any respect, but as a servant
Have not known her this fortnight almost, which is a pain to me
He did very well, but a deadly drinker he is
I took a broom and basted her till she cried extremely
I was a great Roundhead when I was a boy
I was demanded L100, for the fee of the office at 6d. a pound
In discourse he seems to be wise and say little
It not being handsome for our servants to sit so equal with us
Learnt a pretty trick to try whether a woman be a maid or no
Long cloaks being now quite out
Sit up till 2 o'clock that she may call the wench up to wash
Smoke jack consists of a wind-wheel fixed in the chimney
So I took occasion to go up and to bed in a pet
So we went to bed and lay all night in a quarrel
The rest did give more, and did believe that I did so too
There being ten hanged, drawn, and quartered
Thus it was my chance to see the King beheaded at White Hall
To see Major-general Harrison hanged, drawn; and quartered

A lady spit backward upon me by a mistake
A most tedious, unreasonable, and impertinent sermon
Comely black woman.--[The old expression for a brunette.]
Cruel custom of throwing at cocks on Shrove Tuesday
Day I first begun to go forth in my coat and sword
Discontented that my wife do not go neater now she has two maids
Fell to dancing, the first time that ever I did in my life
Have been so long absent that I am ashamed to go
I took occasion to be angry with him
Justice of God in punishing men for the sins of their ancestors
Lady Batten to give me a spoonful of honey for my cold
My great expense at the Coronacion
She hath got her teeth new done by La Roche
That I might not seem to be afeared
The monkey loose, which did anger me, and so I did strike her
Was kissing my wife, which I did not like
We are to go to law never to revenge, but only to repayre
Who we found ill still, but he do make very much of it
Wronged by my over great expectations




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, APR/MAY 1661  [sp12g10.txt]

A little while since a very likely man to live as any I knew
Being sure never to see the like again in this world
Believe that England and France were once the same continent
Chocolate was introduced into England about the year 1652
Did trouble me very much to be at charge to no purpose
Difference there will be between my father and mother about it
Eat of the best cold meats that ever I eat on in all my life
Foolery to take too much notice of such things
Frogs and many insects do often fall from the sky, ready formed
I could not forbear to love her exceedingly
I had the opportunity of kissing Mrs. Rebecca very often
I was as merry as I could counterfeit myself to be
I went in and kissed them, demanding it as a fee due
Jealousy of him and an ugly wench that lived there lately
Lay with her to-night, which I have not done these eight(days)
Made a lazy sermon, like a Presbyterian
She would not let him come to bed to her out of jealousy
So home and to bed, where my wife had not lain a great while
The barber came to trim me and wash me
Troubled to see my father so much decay of a suddain
What people will do tomorrow
What they all, through profit or fear, did promise
Who seems so inquisitive when my, house will be made an end of




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, JUN/JUL/AUG 1661  [sp13g10.txt]

A great baboon, but so much like a man in most things
A play not very good, though commended much
Begun to smell, and so I caused it to be set forth (corpse)
Bleeding behind by leeches will cure
By chewing of tobacco is become very fat and sallow
Cannot bring myself to mind my business
Durst not take notice of her, her husband being there
Faced white coat, made of one of my wife's pettycoates
Family being all in mourning, doing him the greatest honour
Fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands of him again
Finding my wife not sick, but yet out of order
Found him not so ill as I thought that he had been ill
Found my brother John at eight o'clock in bed, which vexed me
Good God! how these ignorant people did cry her up for it!
Greedy to see the will, but did not ask to see it till to-morrow
His company ever wearys me
I broke wind and so came to some ease
I would fain have stolen a pretty dog that followed me
Instructed by Shakespeare himself
Lady Batten how she was such a man's whore
Lately too much given to seeing of plays, and expense
Lewdness and beggary of the Court
Look askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them
None will sell us any thing without our personal security given
Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen
Sat before Mrs. Palmer, the King's mistress, and filled my eyes
So the children and I rose and dined by ourselves
Sorry in some respect, glad in my expectations in another respect
The Alchymist,--Comedy by Ben Jonson
The Lords taxed themselves for the poor--an earl, 1s.
This week made a vow to myself to drink no wine this week
Those absent from prayers were to pay a forfeit
To be so much in love of plays
Woman with a rod in her hand keeping time to the musique




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, SEP/OCT 1661  [sp14g10.txt]

And so by coach, though hard to get it, being rainy, home
But she loves not that I should speak of Mrs. Pierce
God! what an age is this, and what a world is this
In men's clothes, and had the best legs that ever I saw
Inconvenience that do attend the increase of a man's fortune
Man cannot live without playing the knave and dissimulation
My head was not well with the wine that I drank to-day
She is a very good companion as long as she is well
So much wine, that I was even almost foxed
Still in discontent with my wife, to bed, and rose so this morn
This day churched, her month of childbed being out
Vices of the Court, and how the pox is so common there
We do naturally all love the Spanish, and hate the French




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, NOV/DEC 1661  [sp15g10.txt]

After dinner my wife comes up to me and all friends again
Ambassador--that he is an honest man sent to lie abroad
As all things else did not come up to my expectations
Coming to lay out a great deal of money in clothes for my wife
Did extremely beat him, and though it did trouble me to do it
Dominion of the Sea
Exclaiming against men's wearing their hats on in the church
From some fault in the meat to complain of my maid's sluttery
Gamester's life, which I see is very miserable, and poor
Get his lady to trust herself with him into the tavern
Good wine, and anchovies, and pickled oysters (for breakfast)
Like a passionate fool, I did call her whore
My wife and I fell out
Oliver Cromwell as his ensign
Seemed much glad of that it was no more
Sir W. Pen was so fuddled that we could not try him to play
Strange the folly of men to lay and lose so much money
The unlawfull use of lawfull things
Took occasion to fall out with my wife very highly
Took physique, and it did work very well
Tory--The term was not used politically until about 1679
We had a good surloyne of rost beefe

DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MAR/APR 1661/62  [sp18g10.txt]

After taking leave of my wife, which we could hardly do kindly
Agreed at L3 a year (she would not serve under)
All the fleas came to him and not to me
Badge of slavery upon the whole people (taxes)
Did much insist upon the sin of adultery
Discoursed much against a man's lying with his wife in Lent
Fearing that Sarah would continue ill, wife and I removed
Parliament hath voted 2s. per annum for every chimney in England
Peruques of hair, as the fashion now is for ladies to wear
Raising of our roofs higher to enlarge our houses
See a dead man lie floating upon the waters
Sermon; but, it being a Presbyterian one, it was so long
To Mr. Holliard's in the morning, thinking to be let blood
Up early and took my physique; it wrought all the morning well
Whether he would have me go to law or arbitracon with him
Whether she suspected anything or no I know not




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MAY/JUN 1662  [sp19g10.txt]

Afeard of being louzy
Afeard that my Lady Castlemaine will keep still with the King
Afraid now to bring in any accounts for journeys
As much his friend as his interest will let him
Comb my head clean, which I found so foul with powdering
Deliver her from the hereditary curse of child-bearing
Discontented at the pride and luxury of the Court
Enjoy some degree of pleasure now that we have health, money
God forgive me! what a mind I had to her
Hard matter to settle to business after so much leisure
Holes for me to see from my closet into the great office
I know not yet what that is, and am ashamed to ask
King dined at my Lady Castlemaine's, and supped, every day
Lady Castlemaine do speak of going to lie in at Hampton Court
Let me blood, about sixteen ounces, I being exceedingly full
Lust and wicked lives of the nuns heretofore in England

Afeard of being louzy
Afeard that my Lady Castlemaine will keep still with the King
Afraid now to bring in any accounts for journeys
After taking leave of my wife, which we could hardly do kindly
Agreed at L3 a year (she would not serve under)
All may see how slippery places all courtiers stand in
All made much worse in their report among people than they are
All the fleas came to him and not to me
Aptness I have to be troubled at any thing that crosses me
As much his friend as his interest will let him
Badge of slavery upon the whole people (taxes)
Bewailing the vanity and disorders of the age
Bowling-ally (where lords and ladies are now at bowles)
Cannot but be with the workmen to see things done to my mind
Care not for his commands, and especially on Sundays
Catched cold yesterday by putting off my stockings
Charles Barkeley's greatness is only his being pimp to the King
Comb my head clean, which I found so foul with powdering
Command of an army is not beholden to any body to make him King
Deliver her from the hereditary curse of child-bearing
Did much insist upon the sin of adultery
Discontented at the pride and luxury of the Court
Discoursed much against a man's lying with his wife in Lent
Enjoy some degree of pleasure now that we have health, money
Fanatiques do say that the end of the world is at hand
Fear she should prove honest and refuse and then tell my wife
Fearing that Sarah would continue ill, wife and I removed
God forgive me! what a mind I had to her
Goldsmiths in supplying the King with money at dear rates
Hard matter to settle to business after so much leisure
Hate in others, and more in myself, to be careless of keys
He made but a poor sermon, but long
Holes for me to see from my closet into the great office
Hopes to have had a bout with her before she had gone
I fear that it must be as it can, and not as I would
I know not yet what that is, and am ashamed to ask
Joyne the lion's skin to the fox's tail
King dined at my Lady Castlemaine's, and supped, every day
Lady Castlemaine do speak of going to lie in at Hampton Court
Lady Castlemaine is still as great with the King
Lady Castlemaine's interest at Court increases
Last of a great many Presbyterian ministers
Laughing and jeering at every thing that looks strange

At last we pretty good friends
Before I sent my boy out with them, I beat him for a lie
Dr. Calamy is this day sent to Newgate for preaching
Eat a mouthful of pye at home to stay my stomach
Familiarity with her other servants is it that spoils them all
Feverish, and hath sent for Mr. Pierce to let him blood
Found him a fool, as he ever was, or worse
Goes down the wind in honour as well as every thing else
Had a good supper of an oxe's cheek
Hanged with a silken halter

I and she never were so heartily angry in our lives as to-day
Ill humour to be so against that which all the world cries up
Lady Castlemaine hath all the King's Christmas presents
Lay chiding, and then pleased with my wife in bed
Lay very long with my wife in bed talking with great pleasure
Liability of a husband to pay for goods supplied his wife
Many thousands in a little time go out of England
Money, which sweetens all things
Most flat dead sermon, both for matter and manner of delivery
Much discourse, but little to be learned
Nor will yield that the Papists have any ground given them
Nothing in the world done with true integrity
Once a week or so I know a gentleman must go .  .  .  .
Pain of the stone, and makes bloody water with great pain
Rabbit not half roasted, which made me angry with my wife
Scholler, but, it may be, thinks himself to be too much so
See how time and example may alter a man
Servant of the King's pleasures too, as well as business
So home, and mighty friends with my wife again
So neat and kind one to another
Sorry for doing it now, because of obliging me to do the like
Talk very highly of liberty of conscience
The house was full of citizens, and so the less pleasant
There is no passing but by coach in the streets, and hardly that
These young Lords are not fit to do any service abroad
They were so false spelt that I was ashamed of them
Vexed at my wife's neglect in leaving of her scarf
Wine, new and old, with labells pasted upon each bottle
With much ado in an hour getting a coach home
Yet it was her fault not to see that I did take them

Dare not oppose it alone for making an enemy and do no good
Dinner was great, and most neatly dressed
Dog attending us, which made us all merry again
Galileo's air thermometer, made before 1597
I do not find other people so willing to do business as myself

Insurrection of the Catholiques there
Justice of proceeding not to condemn a man unheard
Matters in Ireland are full of discontent

Railed bitterly ever and anon against John Calvin
She is conceited that she do well already
So home to supper and bed with my father

It must be the old ones that must do any good
Jealous, though God knows I have no great reason

Keep at interest, which is a good, quiett, and easy profit
Lay long in bed talking and pleasing myself with my wife
My wife and her maid Ashwell had between them spilled the pot.  .  .  .
No sense nor grammar, yet in as good words that ever I saw
Nor would become obliged too much to any
Nothing is to be got without offending God and the King
Nothing of any truth and sincerity, but mere envy and design
Reading my Latin grammar, which I perceive I have great need
Sad for want of my wife, whom I love with all my heart
Saw his people go up and down louseing themselves
See whether my wife did wear drawers to-day as she used to do
Sent me last night, as a bribe, a barrel of sturgeon
She begins not at all to take pleasure in me or study to please
She used the word devil, which vexed me
So home, and after supper did wash my feet, and so to bed
Softly up to see whether any of the beds were out of order or no
Statute against selling of offices
The goldsmith, he being one of the jury to-morrow
Thence by coach, with a mad coachman, that drove like mad
Therefore ought not to expect more justice from her
They say now a common mistress to the King
Through the Fleete Ally to see a couple of pretty [strumpets]
Upon a small temptation I could be false to her
Waked this morning between four and five by my blackbird
Whose voice I am not to be reconciled
Wife and the dancing-master alone above, not dancing but talking
Would not make my coming troublesome to any

A mad merry slut she is
A real and not a complimentary acknowledgment
At least 12 or 14,000 people in the street (to see the hanging)
Bearing more sayle will go faster than any other ships(multihull)
But the wench went, and I believe had her turn served
Chatted with her, her husband out of the way
Could not saw above 4 inches of the stone in a day
Do look upon me as a remembrancer of his former vanity
Fear of making her think me to be in a better condition
Few in any age that do mind anything that is abstruse
God forgive me! what thoughts and wishes I had
Good writers are not admired by the present
Hear something of the effects of our last meeting (pregnancy?)
I do not like his being angry and in debt both together to me
I will not by any over submission make myself cheap
Ireland in a very distracted condition
Jane going into the boat did fall down and show her arse
King is mighty kind to these his bastard children
King still do doat upon his women, even beyond all shame
Mankind pleasing themselves in the easy delights of the world
Play good, but spoiled with the ryme, which breaks the sense
Pleased to look upon their pretty daughter
Pray God give me a heart to fear a fall, and to prepare for it!
Pretty sayings, which are generally like paradoxes
Ryme, which breaks the sense
Sent my wife to get a place to see Turner hanged
Sheriffs did endeavour to get one jewell
So home to prayers and to bed
Such open flattery is beastly
Talked with Mrs. Lane about persuading her to Hawly
Their saws have no teeth, but it is the sand only
There did see Mrs. Lane.  .  .  .  .
Travels over the high hills in Asia above the clouds
Wherein every party has laboured to cheat another
Willing to receive a bribe if it were offered me
Would make a dogg laugh

Doubtfull of himself, and easily be removed from his own opinion
Drink a dish of coffee
Ill from my late cutting my hair so close to my head
Nothing of the memory of a man, an houre after he is dead!
She had got and used some puppy-dog water
Subject to be put into a disarray upon very small occasions
Very angry we were, but quickly friends again
Went against me to have my wife and servants look upon them

Bath at the top of his house
Fear all his kindness is but only his lust to her
Fetch masts from New England
Find myself to over-value things when a child
Generally with corruption, but most indeed with neglect
I slept soundly all the sermon
In a hackney and full of people, was ashamed to be seen
In my dining-room she was doing something upon the pott
Methought very ill, or else I am grown worse to please
Mrs. Lane was gone forth, and so I missed of my intent
Saw "The German Princess" acted, by the woman herself
Slabbering my band sent home for another
That hair by hair had his horse's tail pulled off indeed

All divided that were bred so long at school together
Began discourse of my not getting of children
Came to bed to me, but all would not make me friends
Feared I might meet with some people that might know me
Had no mind to meddle with her
Her impudent tricks and ways of getting money
How little to be presumed of in our greatest undertakings
Mind to have her bring it home
My wife made great means to be friends, coming to my bedside
Never to trust too much to any man in the world
Not well, and so had no pleasure at all with my poor wife
Not when we can, but when we list
Now against her going into the country (lay together)
Periwigg he lately made me cleansed of its nits
Presse seamen, without which we cannot really raise men
Shakespeare's plays
She had the cunning to cry a great while, and talk and blubber
There eat and drank, and had my pleasure of her twice
These Lords are hard to be trusted
Things wear out of themselves and come fair again
To my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there
Upon a very small occasion had a difference again broke out
Very high and very foule words from her to me
What wine you drinke, lett it bee at meales

New Netherlands to English rule, under the title of New York

About several businesses, hoping to get money by them
After many protestings by degrees I did arrive at what I would
All ended in love
Below what people think these great people say and do
Even to the having bad words with my wife, and blows too
Expected musique, the missing of which spoiled my dinner
Gadding abroad to look after beauties
Greatest businesses are done so superficially
Little children employed, every one to do something
Meazles, we fear, or, at least, of a scarlett feavour
My leg fell in a hole broke on the bridge
My wife was angry with me for not coming home, and for gadding
Not the greatest wits, but the steady man
Rotten teeth and false, set in with wire
Till 12 at night, and then home to supper and to bed
What a sorry dispatch these great persons give to business
What is there more to be had of a woman than the possessing her
Where a trade hath once been and do decay, it never recovers

DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, 1664 N.S. COMPLETE  [sp38g10.txt]

A real and not a complimentary acknowledgment
A mad merry slut she is
About several businesses, hoping to get money by them
After many protestings by degrees I did arrive at what I would
All divided that were bred so long at school together
All ended in love
All the men were dead of the plague, and the ship cast ashore
And with the great men in curing of their claps
At least 12 or 14,000 people in the street (to see the hanging)
Bath at the top of his house
Bearing more sayle will go faster than any other ships(multihull
Began discourse of my not getting of children
Below what people think these great people say and do
But the wench went, and I believe had her turn served
Came to bed to me, but all would not make me friends
Chatted with her, her husband out of the way
Could not saw above 4 inches of the stone in a day
Do look upon me as a remembrancer of his former vanity
Doubtfull of himself, and easily be removed from his own opinion
Drink a dish of coffee
Even to the having bad words with my wife, and blows too
Expected musique, the missing of which spoiled my dinner
Expressly taking care that nobody might see this business done
Fear of making her think me to be in a better condition
Fear all his kindness is but only his lust to her
Feared I might meet with some people that might know me
Fetch masts from New England
Few in any age that do mind anything that is abstruse
Find myself to over-value things when a child
Gadding abroad to look after beauties
Generally with corruption, but most indeed with neglect
God forgive me! what thoughts and wishes I had
Good writers are not admired by the present
Greatest businesses are done so superficially
Had no mind to meddle with her
Having some experience, but greater conceit of it than is fit
Hear something of the effects of our last meeting (pregnancy?)
Helping to slip their calfes when there is occasion
Her months upon her is gone to bed
Her impudent tricks and ways of getting money
How little to be presumed of in our greatest undertakings
I had agreed with Jane Welsh, but she came not, which vexed me
I do not like his being angry and in debt both together to me
I will not by any over submission make myself cheap
I slept soundly all the sermon
Ill from my late cutting my hair so close to my head
In my dining-room she was doing something upon the pott
In a hackney and full of people, was ashamed to be seen
Ireland in a very distracted condition
Irish in Ireland, whom Cromwell had settled all in one corner
Jane going into the boat did fall down and show her arse
King is mighty kind to these his bastard children
King still do doat upon his women, even beyond all shame
Lay long caressing my wife and talking
Let her brew as she has baked
Little children employed, every one to do something
Mankind pleasing themselves in the easy delights of the world
Meazles, we fear, or, at least, of a scarlett feavour
Methought very ill, or else I am grown worse to please
Mind to have her bring it home
Mrs. Lane was gone forth, and so I missed of my intent
My wife was angry with me for not coming home, and for gadding
My leg fell in a hole broke on the bridge
My wife made great means to be friends, coming to my bedside
Never to trust too much to any man in the world
New Netherlands to English rule, under the title of New York
Not well, and so had no pleasure at all with my poor wife
Not when we can, but when we list
Not the greatest wits, but the steady man
Nothing of the memory of a man, an houre after he is dead!
Now against her going into the country (lay together)
Periwigg he lately made me cleansed of its nits
Play good, but spoiled with the ryme, which breaks the sense
Pleased to look upon their pretty daughter
Pray God give me a heart to fear a fall, and to prepare for it!
Presse seamen, without which we cannot really raise men
Pretty sayings, which are generally like paradoxes
Reduced the Dutch settlement of New Netherlands to English rule
Rotten teeth and false, set in with wire
Ryme, which breaks the sense
Saw "The German Princess" acted, by the woman herself
Sent my wife to get a place to see Turner hanged
Shakespeare's plays
She had the cunning to cry a great while, and talk and blubber
She had got and used some puppy-dog water
Sheriffs did endeavour to get one jewell
Slabbering my band sent home for another
So home to prayers and to bed
Staid two hours with her kissing her, but nothing more
Strange slavery that I stand in to beauty
Subject to be put into a disarray upon very small occasions
Such open flattery is beastly
Talked with Mrs. Lane about persuading her to Hawly
Tear all that I found either boyish or not to be worth keeping
That hair by hair had his horse's tail pulled off indeed
Their saws have no teeth, but it is the sand only
There eat and drank, and had my pleasure of her twice
There did see Mrs. Lane.  .  .  .  .
These Lords are hard to be trusted
Things wear out of themselves and come fair again
Thinks she is with child, but I neither believe nor desire it
Till 12 at night, and then home to supper and to bed
To my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there
Travels over the high hills in Asia above the clouds
Up, my mind very light from my last night's accounts
Upon a very small occasion had a difference again broke out
Very angry we were, but quickly friends again
Very high and very foule words from her to me
We do nothing in this office like people able to carry on a warr
Went against me to have my wife and servants look upon them
What wine you drinke, lett it bee at meales
What a sorry dispatch these great persons give to business
What is there more to be had of a woman than the possessing her
Where a trade hath once been and do decay, it never recovers
Wherein every party has laboured to cheat another
Willing to receive a bribe if it were offered me
Would either conform, or be more wise, and not be catched!
Would make a dogg laugh

Accounts I never did see, or hope again to see in my days
At a loss whether it will be better for me to have him die
By his many words and no understanding, confound himself
Church, where a most insipid young coxcomb preached
Clean myself with warm water; my wife will have me
Costs me 12d. a kiss after the first
Find that now and then a little difference do no hurte
Going with her woman to a hot-house to bathe herself
Good discourse and counsel from him, which I hope I shall take
Great thaw it is not for a man to walk the streets
Heard noises over their head upon the leads
His disease was the pox and that he must be fluxed (Rupert)
I know not how their fortunes may agree
If the exportations exceed importations
It is a strange thing how fancy works
Law against it signifies nothing in the world
Law and severity were used against drunkennesse
Luxury and looseness of the times
Must be forced to confess it to my wife, which troubles me
My wife after her bathing lying alone in another bed
No man is wise at all times
Offer to give me a piece to receive of me 20
Pretends to a resolution of being hereafter very clean
Sat an hour or two talking and discoursing .  .  .  .
So great a trouble is fear
Those bred in the North among the colliers are good for labour
Tied our men back to back, and thrown them all into the sea
Too much of it will make her know her force too much
Up, leaving my wife in bed, being sick of her months
When she least shews it hath her wit at work
Where money is free, there is great plenty
Who is the most, and promises the least, of any man
Wife that brings me nothing almost (besides a comely person)

Castlemayne is sicke again, people think, slipping her filly
Desired me that I would baste his coate
Did put evil thoughts in me, but proceeded no further
France, which is accounted the best place for bread
How Povy overdoes every thing in commending it
Never could man say worse himself nor have worse said
Wanton as ever she was, with much I made myself merry and away




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MAY/JUN 1665  [sp41g10.txt]

A vineyard, the first that ever I did see
All the towne almost going out of towne (Plague panic)
Buy some roll-tobacco to smell to and chaw
Consult my pillow upon that and every great thing of my life
Convenience of periwiggs is so great
Dying this last week of the plague 112, from 43 the week before
Hear that the plague is come into the City
Houses marked with a red cross upon the doors
My old folly and childishnesse hangs upon me still
Plague claimed 68,596 victims (in 1665)
Pride of some persons and vice of most was but a sad story
The coachman that carried [us] cannot know me again
Though neither of us care 2d. one for another
Which may teach me how I make others wait

About two o'clock, too late and too soon to go home to bed
And all to dinner and sat down to the King saving myself
Baseness and looseness of the Court
Being able to do little business (but the less the better)
Contracted for her as if he had been buying a horse
Did bear with it, and very pleasant all the while
Doubtfull whether her daughter will like of it or no
Endeavouring to strike tallys for money for Tangier
For, for her part, she should not be buried in the commons
Had what pleasure almost I would with her
Hath a good heart to bear, or a cunning one to conceal his evil
I have promised, but know not when I shall perform
I kissed the bride in bed, and so the curtaines drawne
Less he finds of difference between them and other men
Lord! in the dullest insipid manner that ever lover did
Nan at Moreclacke, very much pleased and merry with her
Not had the confidence to take his lady once by the hand
Out of my purse I dare not for fear of a precedent
Plague, forty last night, the bell always going
Pretty to see the young pretty ladies dressed like men
So to bed, to be up betimes by the helpe of a larum watch
This absence makes us a little strange instead of more fond
What silly discourse we had by the way as to love-matters




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, AUGUST 1665  [sp43g10.txt]

A fair salute on horseback, in Rochester streets, of the lady
Bagwell's wife waited at the door, and went with me to my office
Because I would not be over sure of any thing
Being the first Wednesday of the month
Bottle of strong water; whereof now and then a sip did me good
Copper to the value of L5,000
Disease making us more cruel to one another than if we are doggs
Every body is at a great losse and nobody can tell
Every body's looks, and discourse in the street is of death
First thing of that nature I did ever give her (L10 ring)
For my quiet would not enquire into it
Give the other notice of the future state, if there was any
His wife and three children died, all, I think, in a day
How sad a sight it is to see the streets empty of people
I met a dead corps of the plague, in the narrow ally
In our graves (as Shakespeere resembles it) we could dream
King is not at present in purse to do
King shall not be able to whip a cat
Not liking that it should lie long undone, for fear of death
Ordered in the yarde six or eight bargemen to be whipped
Pest coaches and put her into it to carry her to a pest house
Quakers and others that will not have any bell ring for them
Resolving not to be bribed to dispatch business
Two shops in three, if not more, generally shut up
Well enough pleased this morning with their night's lodging

And feeling for a chamber-pott, there was none
Discourse of Mr. Evelyn touching all manner of learning
Fell to sleep as if angry
King himself minding nothing but his ease
Not to be censured if their necessities drive them to bad
Ordered him L2000, and he paid me my quantum out of it
Sicke men that are recovered, they lying before our office doors
Told us he had not been in a bed in the whole seven years

A conceited man, but of no Logique in his head at all
Best poem that ever was wrote (Siege of Rhodes)
French have taken two and sunk one of our merchant-men
Hath sent me masters that do observe that I take pains
How little heed is had to the prisoners and sicke and wounded
How unhppily a man may fall into a necessity of bribing people
Lechery will never leave him
Money I have not, nor can get
Mr. Evelyn's translating and sending me as a present
Poor seamen that lie starving in the streets
Saying me to be the fittest man in England
Searchers with their rods in their hands

A most conceited fellow and not over much in him
A pretty man, I would be content to break a commandment with him
Among  many lazy people that the diligent man becomes necessary
Delight to see these poor fools decoyed into our condition
Great many silly stories they tell of their sport
His enemies have done him as much good as he could wish
How little merit do prevail in the world, but only favour
I am a foole to be troubled at it, since I cannot helpe it
L10,000 to the Prince, and half-a-crowne to my Lord of Sandwich
Left him with some Commanders at the table taking tobacco
One whom a great belly becomes as well as ever I saw any
Pleases them mightily, and me not at all
See how a good dinner and feasting reconciles everybody
The boy is well, and offers to be searched

After a harsh word or two my wife and I good friends
By and by met at her chamber, and there did what I would
Did drink of the College beer, which is very good
Got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with her
Lady Duchesse the veryest slut and drudge
Last act of friendship in telling me of my faults also
Scotch song of "Barbary Allen"
Tooth-ake made him no company, and spoilt ours
Wherewith to give every body something for their pains
Who must except against every thing and remedy nothing

Ashamed at myself for this losse of time
Begun to write idle and from the purpose
Counterfeit mirthe and pleasure with them, but had but little
Driven down again with a stinke by Sir W. Pen's shying of a pot
Great newes of the Swedes declaring for us against the Dutch
He has been inconvenienced by being too free in discourse
Mass, and some of their musique, which is not so contemptible
Reading over my dear "Faber fortunae," of my Lord Bacon's
Thence to Mrs. Martin's, and did what I would with her
Through want of money and good conduct
Too late for them to enjoy it with any pleasure
Tooke my wife well dressed into the Hall to see and be seen

A cat will be a cat still
And if ever I fall on it again, I deserve to be undone
Apprehension of the King of France's invading us
As very a gossip speaking of her neighbours as any body
Baited at Islington, and so late home about 11 at night
Called at a little ale-house, and had an eele pye
Checking her last night in the coach in her long stories
Foretelling the draught of water of a ship before she be launche
Great deale of tittle tattle discourse to little purpose
He is such innocent company
Here I first saw oranges grow
I do not value her, or mind her as I ought
I to bed even by daylight
Long petticoat dragging under their men's coats
Mightily pleased with myself for the business that I have done
Mightily vexed at my being abroad with these women
Never fought with worse officers in his life
Not being well pleased with her over free and loose company
Now very big, and within a fortnight of lying down
Out also to and fro, to see and be seen
Providing against a foule day to get as much money into my hands
Rejoiced over head and ears in this good newes
Requisite I be prepared against the man's friendship
Sang till about twelve at night, with mighty pleasure
Send up and down for a nurse to take the girle home
Shy of any warr hereafter, or to prepare better for it
So back again home to supper and to bed with great pleasure
So home and to supper with beans and bacon and to bed
That I may look as a man minding business
There did what I would with her
There did what 'je voudrais avec' her .  .  .  .
Think that we are beaten in every respect
This is the use we make of our fathers
Took him home the money, and, though much to my grief
Unless my too-much addiction to pleasure undo me
What itching desire I did endeavour to see Bagwell's wife
Young man play the foole upon the doctrine of purgatory

Better the musique, the more sicke it makes him
Contempt of the ceremoniousnesse of the King of Spayne
Listening to no reasoning for it, be it good or bad
Many women now-a-days of mean sort in the streets, but no men
Milke, which I drank to take away, my heartburne
No money to do it with, nor anybody to trust us without it
Rather hear a cat mew, than the best musique in the world
Says, of all places, if there be hell, it is here
So to bed in some little discontent, but no words from me
The gentlemen captains will undo us
To bed, after washing my legs and feet with warm water
Venison-pasty that we have for supper to-night to the cook's
With a shower of hail as big as walnuts
World sees now the use of them for shelter of men (fore-castles)

About my new closet, for my mind is full of nothing but that
About the nature of sounds
All the innocent pleasure in the world
Angry, and so continued till bed, and did not sleep friends
Beare-garden
Being examined at Allgate, whether we were husbands and wives
Did dig another, and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan cheese
Do bury still of the plague seven or eight in a day
Durst not ask any body how it was with us
Evelyn, who cries out against it, and calls it bitchering
Fire grow; and, as it grew darker, appeared more and more
Good sport of the bull's tossing of the dogs
Great fire they saw in the City
Horrid malicious bloody flame
I never did observe so much of myself in my life
No manner of means used to quench the fire
Not permit her begin to do so, lest worse should follow
Offered to stop the fire near his house for such a reward
Pain to ride in a coach with them, for fear of being seen
Plot in it, and that the French had done it
Put up with too much care, that I have forgot where they are
Removing goods from one burned house to another
Sad sight it was: the whole City almost on fire

DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, 1666 N.S. COMPLETE  [sp56g10.txt]

A cat will be a cat still
About the nature of sounds
About my new closet, for my mind is full of nothing but that
After a harsh word or two my wife and I good friends
All the innocent pleasure in the world
Amending of bad blood by borrowing from a better body
And if ever I fall on it again, I deserve to be undone
And for his beef, says he, "Look how fat it is"
Angry, and so continued till bed, and did not sleep friends
Apprehension of the King of France's invading us
As very a gossip speaking of her neighbours as any body
Ashamed at myself for this losse of time
Baited at Islington, and so late home about 11 at night
Beare-garden
Begun to write idle and from the purpose
Being there, and seeming to do something, while we do not
Being examined at Allgate, whether we were husbands and wives
Being five years behindhand for their wages (court musicians)
Better the musique, the more sicke it makes him
Bill against importing Irish cattle
Bringing over one discontented man, you raise up three
But pretty!  how I took another pretty woman for her
But fit she should live where he hath a mind
But how many years I cannot tell; but my wife says ten
By and by met at her chamber, and there did what I would
Called at a little ale-house, and had an eele pye
Catholiques are everywhere and bold
Checking her last night in the coach in her long stories
Contempt of the ceremoniousnesse of the King of Spayne
Counterfeit mirthe and pleasure with them, but had but little
Did tumble them all the afternoon as I pleased
Did drink of the College beer, which is very good
Did dig another, and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan cheese
Discoursing upon the sad condition of the times
Do bury still of the plague seven or eight in a day
Driven down again with a stinke by Sir W. Pen's shying of a pot
Durst not ask any body how it was with us
Evelyn, who cries out against it, and calls it bitchering
Exceeding kind to me, more than usual, which makes me afeard
Fashion, the King says; he will never change
Fire grow; and, as it grew darker, appeared more and more
First their apes, that they may be afterwards their slaves
For a land-tax and against a general excise
Foretelling the draught of water of a ship before she be launche
Gladder to have just now received it (than a promise)
Good sport of the bull's tossing of the dogs
Got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with her
Great fire they saw in the City
Great deale of tittle tattle discourse to little purpose
Great newes of the Swedes declaring for us against the Dutch
He is such innocent company
He has been inconvenienced by being too free in discourse
Here I first saw oranges grow
Horrid malicious bloody flame
I to bed even by daylight
I do not value her, or mind her as I ought
I did what I would, and might have done anything else
I never did observe so much of myself in my life
I had six noble dishes for them, dressed by a man-cook
In opposition to France, had made us throw off their fashion
King hath lost his power, by submitting himself to this way
King be desired to put all Catholiques out of employment
Lady Duchesse the veryest slut and drudge
Last act of friendship in telling me of my faults also
Listening to no reasoning for it, be it good or bad
Long petticoat dragging under their men's coats
Magnifying the graces of the nobility and prelates
Many women now-a-days of mean sort in the streets, but no men
Mass, and some of their musique, which is not so contemptible
Mightily pleased with myself for the business that I have done
Mightily vexed at my being abroad with these women
Milke, which I drank to take away, my heartburne
Most homely widow, but young, and pretty rich, and good natured
Never fought with worse officers in his life
No Parliament can, as he says, be kept long good
No manner of means used to quench the fire
No money to do it with, nor anybody to trust us without it
Not being well pleased with her over free and loose company
Not permit her begin to do so, lest worse should follow
Now very big, and within a fortnight of lying down
Offered to stop the fire near his house for such a reward
Origin in the use of a plane against the grain of the wood
Out also to and fro, to see and be seen
Pain to ride in a coach with them, for fear of being seen
Peace with France, which, as a Presbyterian, he do not like
Play on the harpsicon, till she tired everybody
Plot in it, and that the French had done it
Providing against a foule day to get as much money into my hands
Put up with too much care, that I have forgot where they are
Rather hear a cat mew, than the best musique in the world
Reading over my dear "Faber fortunae," of my Lord Bacon's
Reading to my wife and brother something in Chaucer
Rejoiced over head and ears in this good newes
Removing goods from one burned house to another
Requisite I be prepared against the man's friendship
Sad sight it was: the whole City almost on fire
Said that there hath been a design to poison the King
Sang till about twelve at night, with mighty pleasure
Says, of all places, if there be hell, it is here
Scotch song of "Barbary Allen"
Send up and down for a nurse to take the girle home
Shy of any warr hereafter, or to prepare better for it
So home to supper, and to bed, it being my wedding night
So back again home to supper and to bed with great pleasure
So to bed in some little discontent, but no words from me
So home and to supper with beans and bacon and to bed
Staying out late, and painting in the absence of her husband
Tax the same man in three or four several capacities
That I may have nothing by me but what is worth keeping
That I may look as a man minding business
The gentlemen captains will undo us
The very rum man must have L200
Thence to Mrs. Martin's, and did what I would with her
There did what 'je voudrais avec' her .  .  .  .
There did 'tout ce que je voudrais avec' her
There I did lay the beginnings of a future 'amour con elle'
There did what I would with her
Think that we are beaten in every respect
This is the use we make of our fathers
This unhappinesse of ours do give them heart
Through want of money and good conduct
Time spending, and no money to set anything in hand
To bed, after washing my legs and feet with warm water
Too late for them to enjoy it with any pleasure
Too much ill newes true, to afflict ourselves with uncertain
Took him home the money, and, though much to my grief
Tooke my wife well dressed into the Hall to see and be seen
Tooth-ake made him no company, and spoilt ours
Unless my too-much addiction to pleasure undo me
Venison-pasty that we have for supper to-night to the cook's
Weary of the following of my pleasure
What I had writ foule in short hand
What itching desire I did endeavour to see Bagwell's wife
Wherewith to give every body something for their pains
Who must except against every thing and remedy nothing
With a shower of hail as big as walnuts
World sees now the use of them for shelter of men (fore-castles)
Ye pulling down of houses, in ye way of ye fire
Young man play the foole upon the doctrine of purgatory

Baker's house in Pudding Lane, where the late great fire begun
Bill against importing Cattle from Ireland
But my wife vexed, which vexed me
Clap of the pox which he got about twelve years ago
Come to us out of bed in his furred mittens and furred cap
Court full of great apprehensions of the French
Declared he will never have another public mistress again
Desk fastened to one of the armes of his chayre
Do outdo the Lords infinitely (debates in the Commons)
Enough existed to build a ship (Pieces of the true Cross)
Enviously, said, I could not come honestly by them
Erasmus "de scribendis epistolis"
For I will be hanged before I seek to him, unless I see I need
Gold holds up its price still
Have not any awe over them from the King's displeasure (Commons)
He will do no good, he being a man of an unsettled head
I did get her hand to me under my cloak
I perceive no passion in a woman can be lasting long
Mazer or drinking-bowl turned out of some kind of wood
Mirrors which makes the room seem both bigger and lighter
Outdo for neatness and plenty anything done by any of them
Poll Bill
Saying, that for money he might be got to our side
Sermon without affectation or study
Some ends of my own in what advice I do give her
The pleasure of my not committing these things to my memory
Very great tax; but yet I do think it is so perplexed
Where a piece of the Cross is
Whip this child till the blood come, if it were my child!
Whom, in mirth to us, he calls Antichrist
Wonders that she cannot be as good within as she is fair without
Yet let him remember the days of darkness




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, FEBRUARY 1966/67  [sp58g10.txt]

Being taken with a Psalmbook or Testament
Consider that this is all the pleasure I live for in the world
Dinner, an ill and little mean one, with foul cloth and dishes
If the word Inquisition be but mentioned
King's service is undone, and those that trust him perish
Mean, methinks, and is as if they had married like dog and bitch
Musique in the morning to call up our new-married people
Must yet pay to the Poll Bill for this pension (unreceived)
New medall, where, in little, there is Mrs. Steward's face
Not thinking them safe men to receive such a gratuity
Only because she sees it is the fashion (She likes it)
Prince's being trepanned, which was in doing just as we passed
Proud that she shall come to trill
Receive the applications of people, and hath presents
Seems she hath had long melancholy upon her
Sermon upon Original Sin, neither understood by himself
Sick of it and of him for it
The world do not grow old at all
Then home, and merry with my wife
Though he knows, if he be not a fool, that I love him not
To my joy, I met not with any that have sped better than myself
Used to make coal fires, and wash my foul clothes




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MARCH 1966/67  [sp59g10.txt]

Angling with a minikin, a gut-string varnished over
Better now than never
Bring me a periwig, but it was full of nits
Buying up of goods in case there should be war
For I will not be inward with him that is open to another
He is a man of no worth in the world but compliment
History of this day's growth, we cannot tell the truth
I love the treason I hate the traitor
King of France did think other princes fit for nothing
My wife will keep to one another and let the world go hang
No man knowing what to do, whether to sell or buy
Not more than I expected, nor so much by a great deal as I ought
Now above six months since (smoke from the cellars)
Reparation for what we had embezzled
Uncertainty of all history
Whatever I do give to anybody else, I shall give her




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, APRIL 1667  [sp60g10.txt]

As he called it, the King's seventeenth whore abroad
He is not a man fit to be told what one hears
I having now seen a play every day this week
Ill sign when we are once to come to study how to excuse
King is offended with the Duke of Richmond's marrying
Mrs. Stewart's sending the King his jewels again
Much difficulty to get pews, I offering the sexton money
My people do observe my minding my pleasure more than usual
My wife this night troubled at my leaving her alone so much
Never was known to keep two mistresses in his life (Charles II.)
Officers are four years behind-hand unpaid
Sparrowgrass
Suspect the badness of the peace we shall make
Swear they will not go to be killed and have no pay




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MAY 1667  [sp61g10.txt]

Advantage a man of the law hath over all other people
Certainly Annapolis must be defended,--where is Annapolis?
Credit of this office hath received by this rogue's occasion
Did take me up very prettily in one or two things that I said
Father, who to supper and betimes to bed at his country hours
Give the King of France Nova Scotia, which he do not like
Hath given her the pox, but I hope it is not so
How do the children?
Hunt up and down with its mouth if you touch the cheek
Just set down to dinner, and I dined with them, as I intended
Little worth of this world, to buy it with so much pain
Looks to lie down about two months hence
Pit, where the bears are baited
Said to die with the cleanest hands that ever any Lord Treasurer
Says of wood, that it is an excrescence of the earth
Shame such a rogue should give me and all of us this trouble
Street ordered to be continued, forty feet broad, from Paul's
Think never to see this woman--at least, to have her here more
We find the two young ladies come home, and their patches off
Which he left him in the lurch
Who continues so ill as not to be troubled with business
Whose red nose makes me ashamed to be seen with him
Wretch, n., often used as an expression of endearment

Buying his place of my Lord Barkely
Heeling her on one side to make her draw little water
Know yourself to be secure, in being necessary to the office
Night the Dutch burned our ships the King did sup with Castlemayne
Young fellow, with his hat cocked like a fool behind

20s. in money, and what wine she needed, for the burying him
Archbishop is a wencher, and known to be so
Bold to deliver what he thinks on every occasion
Cast stones with his horne crooke
Court is in a way to ruin all for their pleasures
Dash the brains of it out before the King's face
Dog, that would turn a sheep any way which
Dutch fleets being in so many places
Fool's play with which all publick things are done
Good purpose of fitting ourselves for another war (A Peace)
He was charged with making himself popular
King governed by his lust, and women, and rogues about him
King is at the command of any woman like a slave
King the necessity of having, at least, a show of religion
Never to keep a country-house, but to keep a coach
Nobody being willing to trust us for anything
She has this silly vanity that she must play
So every thing stands still for money
They are all mad; and thus the kingdom is governed!
What way a man could devise to lose so much in so little time




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, AUGUST 1667  [sp64g10.txt]

Beginnings of discontents take so much root between us
Eat some of the best cheese-cakes that ever I eat in my life
Hugged, it being cold now in the mornings .  .  .  .
I would not enquire into anything, but let her talk
Ill-bred woman, would take exceptions at anything any body said
Kingdom will fall back again to a commonwealth
Little content most people have in the peace
Necessary, and yet the peace is so bad in its terms
Never laughed so in all my life.  I laughed till my head ached
Nobody knows which side will be uppermost
Sermon ended, and the church broke up, and my amours ended also
Spends his time here most, playing at bowles
Take pins out of her pocket to prick me if I should touch her
The gates of the City shut, it being so late
They want where to set their feet, to begin to do any thing
Troubled to think what trouble a rogue may without cause give
Wise men do prepare to remove abroad what they have

Act of Council passed, to put out all Papists in office
And a deal of do of which I am weary
But do it with mighty vanity and talking
Feared she hath from some [one] or other of a present
Fell a-crying for joy, being all maudlin and kissing one another
Found to be with child, do never stir out of their beds
Had his hand cut off, and was hanged presently!
Hates to have any body mention what he had done the day before
House of Lords is the last appeal that a man can make
I find her painted, which makes me loathe her (cosmetics)
King do resolve to declare the Duke of Monmouth legitimate
Lady Castlemayne is compounding with the King for a pension
My intention to learn to trill
Never, while he lives, truckle under any body or any faction
Pressing in it as if none of us had like care with him
Singing with many voices is not singing
Their condition was a little below my present state
Weary of it; but it will please the citizens
Weigh him after he had done playing

Anthem anything but instrumentall musique with the voice
Chief Court of judicature (House of Lords)
Confidence, and vanity, and disparages everything
Had the umbles of it for dinner
I am not a man able to go through trouble, as other men
Liberty of speech in the House
Nor offer anything, but just what is drawn out of a man
Through my wife's illness had a bad night of it, and she a worse
What I said would not hold water

Run over their beads with one hand, and point and play and talk
Silence; it being seldom any wrong to a man to say nothing

Suspect the badness of the peace we shall make
Swear they will not go to be killed and have no pay
Take pins out of her pocket to prick me if I should touch her
The pleasure of my not committing these things to my memory
The world do not grow old at all
The gates of the City shut, it being so late
Their condition was a little below my present state
Then home, and merry with my wife
They are all mad; and thus the kingdom is governed!
They want where to set their feet, to begin to do any thing
Think never to see this woman--at least, to have her here more
Though he knows, if he be not a fool, that I love him not
Through my wife's illness had a bad night of it, and she a worse
To my joy, I met not with any that have sped better than myself
Troubled to think what trouble a rogue may without cause give
Uncertainty of all history
Used to make coal fires, and wash my foul clothes
Very great tax; but yet I do think it is so perplexed
Voyage to Newcastle for coles
We find the two young ladies come home, and their patches off
Weary of it; but it will please the citizens
Weigh him after he had done playing
What way a man could devise to lose so much in so little time
What I said would not hold water
Whatever I do give to anybody else, I shall give her
Where a piece of the Cross is
Which he left him in the lurch
Whip this child till the blood come, if it were my child!
Who continues so ill as not to be troubled with business
Whom, in mirth to us, he calls Antichrist
Whose red nose makes me ashamed to be seen with him
Wise man's not being wise at all times
Wise men do prepare to remove abroad what they have
Wonders that she cannot be as good within as she is fair without
Wretch, n., often used as an expression of endearment
Yet let him remember the days of darkness
Young fellow, with his hat cocked like a fool behind

And they did lay pigeons to his feet
As all other women, cry, and yet talk of other things
Carry them to a box, which did cost me 20s., besides oranges
Declared, if he come, she would not live with me
Fear that the goods and estate would be seized (after suicide)
Fears some will stand for the tolerating of Papists
Greater number of Counsellors is, the more confused the issue
He that will not stoop for a pin, will never be worth a pound
In my nature am mighty unready to answer no to anything
It may be, be able to pay for it, or have health
Lady Castlemayne do rule all at this time as much as ever
No man was ever known to lose the first time
She loves to be taken dressing herself, as I always find her
The devil being too cunning to discourage a gamester
The manner of the gaming
This kind of prophane, mad entertainment they give themselves
Turn out every man that will be drunk, they must turn out all
Where I expect most I find least satisfaction

Being very poor and mean as to the bearing with trouble
Bite at the stone, and not at the hand that flings it
Burned it, that it might not be among my books to my shame
Come to see them in bed together, on their wedding-night
Fear what would become of me if any real affliction should come
Force a man to swear against himself
L'escholle des filles, a lewd book
Live of L100 a year with more plenty, and wine and wenches
No pleasure--only the variety of it




DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, MARCH 1667/68  [sp72g10.txt]

Act against Nonconformists and Papists
Bookseller's, and there looked for Montaigne's Essays
Bought Montaigne's Essays, in English
But if she will ruin herself, I cannot help it
Endangering the nation, when he knew himself such a coward
I know not how in the world to abstain from reading
Inventing a better theory of musique
King, "it is then but Mr. Pepys making of another speech to them"
Never saw so many sit four hours together to hear any man
Not eat a bit of good meat till he has got money to pay the men
Slabbering themselves, and mirth fit for clownes
To be enjoyed while we are young and capable of these joys
Tried the effect of my silence and not provoking her
Trouble, and more money, to every Watch, to them to drink
Uncertainty of beauty
Without importunity or the contrary

Best fence against the Parliament's present fury is delay
But this the world believes, and so let them
Coach to W. Coventry about Mrs. Pett, 1s.
Ever have done his maister better service than to hang for him?
Making their own advantages to the disturbance of the peace
Parliament being vehement against the Nonconformists
Rough notes were made to serve for a sort of account book
Saw two battles of cocks, wherein is no great sport
Whip a boy at each place they stop at in their procession
Work that is not made the work of any one man

And will not kiss a woman since his wife's death
Beating of a poor little dog to death, letting it lie
City to be burned, and the Papists to cut our throats
Disorder in the pit by its raining in, from the cupola
Down to the Whey house and drank some and eat some curds
Eat some butter and radishes
Little company there, which made it very unpleasing
So time do alter, and do doubtless the like in myself
There setting a poor man to keep my place

Cannot be clean to go so many bodies together in the same water
City pay him great respect, and he the like to the meanest
Cost me L5, which troubles me, but yet do please me also
Espinette is the French term for a small harpsichord
Forced to change gold, 8s. 7d.; servants and poor, 1s. 6d.
Frequent trouble in things we deserve best in
How natural it is for us to slight people out of power
I could have answered, but forbore
Little pleasure now in a play, the company being but little
Made him admire my drawing a thing presently in shorthand
My wife hath something in her gizzard, that only waits
My wife's neglect of things, and impertinent humour
So out, and lost our way, which made me vexed
Suffered her humour to spend, till we begun to be very quiet
Troubled me, to see the confidence of the vice of the age
Up, finding our beds good, but lousy; which made us merry
Weather being very wet and hot to keep meat in.
When he was seriously ill he declared himself a Roman Catholic
Where a pedlar was in bed, and made him rise

Statute against selling of offices
Staying out late, and painting in the absence of her husband
Still in discontent with my wife, to bed, and rose so this morn
Strange slavery that I stand in to beauty
Strange thing how I am already courted by the people
Strange things he has been found guilty of, not fit to name
Strange the folly of men to lay and lose so much money
Strange how civil and tractable he was to me
Street ordered to be continued, forty feet broad, from Paul's
Subject to be put into a disarray upon very small occasions

The rest did give more, and did believe that I did so too
Their ladies in the box, being grown mighty kind of a sudden
Their saws have no teeth, but it is the sand only
Their condition was a little below my present state
Then to church to a tedious sermon
Then home, and merry with my wife
Thence by coach, with a mad coachman, that drove like mad
Thence to Mrs. Martin's, and did what I would with her
There is no passing but by coach in the streets, and hardly that
There did see Mrs. Lane.  .  .  .  .
There eat and drank, and had my pleasure of her twice
There did 'tout ce que je voudrais avec' her
There did what 'je voudrais avec' her .  .  .  .
There setting a poor man to keep my place
There is no man almost in the City cares a turd for him
There being no curse in the world so great as this
There I did lay the beginnings of a future 'amour con elle'
There being ten hanged, drawn, and quartered
There did what I would with her
Therefore ought not to expect more justice from her
These young Lords are not fit to do any service abroad
These Lords are hard to be trusted
They are all mad; and thus the kingdom is governed!
They were so false spelt that I was ashamed of them
They say now a common mistress to the King
They were not occupiers, but occupied (women)
They want where to set their feet, to begin to do any thing
Things wear out of themselves and come fair again
Things being dear and little attendance to be had we went away
Think never to see this woman--at least, to have her here more
Think that we are beaten in every respect
Thinks she is with child, but I neither believe nor desire it
This day churched, her month of childbed being out
This absence makes us a little strange instead of more fond
This week made a vow to myself to drink no wine this week
This day I began to put on buckles to my shoes
This afternoon I showed my Lord my accounts, which he passed
This unhappinesse of ours do give them heart
This is the use we make of our fathers
This kind of prophane, mad entertainment they give themselves
Those absent from prayers were to pay a forfeit
Those bred in the North among the colliers are good for labour
Though it be but little, yet I do get ground every month
Though I know it will set the Office and me by the ears for ever
Though neither of us care 2d. one for another
Though he knows, if he be not a fool, that I love him not
Through want of money and good conduct
Through the Fleete Ally to see a couple of pretty [strumpets]
Through my wife's illness had a bad night of it, and she a worse
Thus it was my chance to see the King beheaded at White Hall
Tied our men back to back, and thrown them all into the sea
Till 12 at night, and then home to supper and to bed
Time spending, and no money to set anything in hand
To Mr. Holliard's in the morning, thinking to be let blood
To bed with discontent she yielded to me and began to be fond
To bed, after washing my legs and feet with warm water
To my joy, I met not with any that have sped better than myself
To my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there
To be enjoyed while we are young and capable of these joys
To be so much in love of plays
To see Major-general Harrison hanged, drawn; and quartered
To the Swan and drank our morning draft
To see the bride put to bed
Told us he had not been in a bed in the whole seven years
Too late for them to enjoy it with any pleasure
Too much ill newes true, to afflict ourselves with uncertain
Too much of it will make her know her force too much
Took him home the money, and, though much to my grief
Took occasion to fall out with my wife very highly
Took physique, and it did work very well
Tooke my wife well dressed into the Hall to see and be seen
Tooth-ake made him no company, and spoilt ours
Tory--The term was not used politically until about 1679
Towzing her and doing what I would, but the last thing of all.  .  .  .
Travels over the high hills in Asia above the clouds
Tried the effect of my silence and not provoking her
Trouble, and more money, to every Watch, to them to drink
Troubled to see my father so much decay of a suddain
Troubled to think what trouble a rogue may without cause give
Troubled me, to see the confidence of the vice of the age
Trumpets were brought under the scaffold that he not be heard
Turn out every man that will be drunk, they must turn out all
Two shops in three, if not more, generally shut up
Uncertainty of all history
Uncertainty of beauty
Unless my too-much addiction to pleasure undo me
Unquiet which her ripping up of old faults will give me
Up, leaving my wife in bed, being sick of her months
Up, and with W. Hewer, my guard, to White Hall
Up, my mind very light from my last night's accounts
Up early and took my physique; it wrought all the morning well
Up, finding our beds good, but lousy; which made us merry
Up and took physique, but such as to go abroad with
Upon a very small occasion had a difference again broke out
Upon the leads gazing upon Diana
Upon a small temptation I could be false to her
Used to make coal fires, and wash my foul clothes
Venison-pasty that we have for supper to-night to the cook's
Very high and very foule words from her to me
Very angry we were, but quickly friends again
Very great tax; but yet I do think it is so perplexed
Vexed at my wife's neglect in leaving of her scarf
Vexed me, but I made no matter of it, but vexed to myself
Vices of the Court, and how the pox is so common there
Voyage to Newcastle for coles
Waked this morning between four and five by my blackbird
Wanton as ever she was, with much I made myself merry and away
Was kissing my wife, which I did not like
We having no luck in maids now-a-days
We cannot tell what to do for want of her (the maid)
We find the two young ladies come home, and their patches off
We do nothing in this office like people able to carry on a warr
We do naturally all love the Spanish, and hate the French
We are to go to law never to revenge, but only to repayre
We had a good surloyne of rost beefe
Weary of it; but it will please the citizens
Weary of the following of my pleasure
Weather being very wet and hot to keep meat in.
Wedding for which the posy ring was required
Weeping to myself for grief, which she discerning, come to bed
Weigh him after he had done playing
Well enough pleased this morning with their night's lodging
Went against me to have my wife and servants look upon them
Went to bed with my head not well by my too much drinking to-day
What way a man could devise to lose so much in so little time
What I said would not hold water
What I had writ foule in short hand
What itching desire I did endeavour to see Bagwell's wife
What wine you drinke, lett it bee at meales
What people will do tomorrow
What they all, through profit or fear, did promise
What silly discourse we had by the way as to love-matters
What a sorry dispatch these great persons give to business
What is there more to be had of a woman than the possessing her
Whatever I do give to anybody else, I shall give her
When she least shews it hath her wit at work
When he was seriously ill he declared himself a Roman Catholic
When the candle is going out, how they bawl and dispute
Where money is free, there is great plenty
Where a pedlar was in bed, and made him rise
Where I find the worst very good
Where a piece of the Cross is
Where a trade hath once been and do decay, it never recovers
Where I expect most I find least satisfaction
Wherein every party has laboured to cheat another
Wherewith to give every body something for their pains
Whether she suspected anything or no I know not
Whether he would have me go to law or arbitracon with him
Which may teach me how I make others wait
Which he left him in the lurch
Which I did give him some hope of, though I never intend it
Whip this child till the blood come, if it were my child!
Whip a boy at each place they stop at in their procession
Who continues so ill as not to be troubled with business
Who is the most, and promises the least, of any man
Who we found ill still, but he do make very much of it
Who must except against every thing and remedy nothing
Who seems so inquisitive when my, house will be made an end of
Who is over head and eares in getting her house up
Whom, in mirth to us, he calls Antichrist
Whom I find in bed, and pretended a little not well
Whose red nose makes me ashamed to be seen with him
Whose voice I am not to be reconciled
Wife that brings me nothing almost (besides a comely person)
Wife and the dancing-master alone above, not dancing but talking
Will upon occasion serve for a fine withdrawing room
Will put Madam Castlemaine's nose out of joynt
Willing to receive a bribe if it were offered me
Wine, new and old, with labells pasted upon each bottle
Wise man's not being wise at all times
Wise men do prepare to remove abroad what they have
With much ado in an hour getting a coach home
With hangings not fit to be seen with mine
With egg to keep off the glaring of the light
With my whip did whip him till I was not able to stir
With a shower of hail as big as walnuts
Without importunity or the contrary
Woman that they have a fancy to, to make her husband a cuckold
Woman with a rod in her hand keeping time to the musique
Wonders that she cannot be as good within as she is fair without
Work that is not made the work of any one man
World sees now the use of them for shelter of men (fore-castles)
Would make a dogg laugh
Would either conform, or be more wise, and not be catched!
Would not make my coming troublesome to any
Wretch, n., often used as an expression of endearment
Wronged by my over great expectations
Ye pulling down of houses, in ye way of ye fire
Yet let him remember the days of darkness
Yet it was her fault not to see that I did take them
Young man play the foole upon the doctrine of purgatory
Young fellow, with his hat cocked like a fool behind
