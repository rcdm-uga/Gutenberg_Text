                  QUOTATIONS FROM THE HISTORICAL NOVELS
                                   OF
                               GEORG EBERS


UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v1  [GE#01][ge01v10.txt]5439

A dirty road serves when it makes for the goal
Colored cakes in the shape of beasts
Deficient are as guilty in their eyes as the idle
For fear of the toothache, had his sound teeth drawn
Hatred between man and man
Hatred for all that hinders the growth of light
How tender is thy severity
Judge only by appearances, and never enquire into the causes
Often happens that apparent superiority does us damage
Seditious words are like sparks, which are borne by the wind
The scholar's ears are at his back: when he is flogged
Title must not be a bill of fare
Youth should be modest, and he was assertive




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v2  [GE#02][ge02v10.txt]5440

Blossom of the thorny wreath of sorrow
Eyes kind and frank, without tricks of glance
Money is a pass-key that turns any lock
Repugnance for the old laws began to take root in his heart
Thou canst say in words what we can only feel
Whether the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v3  [GE#03][ge03v10.txt]5441

Bearers of ill ride faster than the messengers of weal
Do not spoil the future for the sake of the present
Exhibit one's happiness in the streets, and conceal one's misery
Impartial looker-on sees clearer than the player
Learn to obey, that later you may know how to command
Man has nothing harder to endure than uncertainty
Many creditors are so many allies
One should give nothing up for lost excepting the dead
Our thinkers are no heroes, and our heroes are no sages
Overbusy friends are more damaging than intelligent enemies
Prepare sorrow when we come into the world

UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v4  [GE#04][ge04v10.txt]5442

Ardently they desire that which transcends sense
Every misfortune brings its fellow with it
Medicines work harm as often as good
No good excepting that from which we expect the worst
Obstinacy--which he liked to call firm determination
Only the choice between lying and silence
Patronizing friendliness
Principle of over-estimating the strength of our opponents
Provide yourself with a self-devised ruler
Successes, like misfortunes, never come singly
The beginning of things is not more attractive




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v5  [GE#05][ge05v10.txt]5443

Ask for what is feasible
I know that I am of use
Like the cackle of hens, which is peculiar to Eastern women
Think of his wife, not with affection only, but with pride
Those whom we fear, says my uncle, we cannot love




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v6  [GE#06][ge06v10.txt]5444

Her white cat was playing at her feet
Human sacrifices, which had been introduced into Egypt by the Phoenicians
The dressing and undressing of the holy images
Thought that the insane were possessed by demons
Use words instead of swords, traps instead of lances




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v7  [GE#07][ge07v10.txt]5445

Age when usually even bad liquor tastes of honey
How easy it is to give wounds, and how hard it is to heal
Kisra called wine the soap of sorrow
No one so self-confident and insolent as just such an idiot
The mother of foresight looks backwards




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v8  [GE#08][ge08v10.txt]5446

An admirer of the lovely color of his blue bruises
Called his daughter to wash his feet
Desert is a wonderful physician for a sick soul
He is clever and knows everything, but how silly he looks now
If it were right we should not want to hide ourselves
None of us really know anything rightly
One falsehood usually entails another
Refreshed by the whip of one of the horsemen




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v9  [GE#09][ge09v10.txt]5447

Learn early to pass lightly over little things
Trustfulness is so dear, so essential to me




UARDA,                 by Georg Ebers, v10 [GE#10][ge10v10.txt]5448

Drink of the joys of life thankfully, and in moderation
It is not seeing, it is seeking that is delightful
The man within him, and not on the circumstances without




UARDA,                 by Ebers, Complete  [GE#11][ge11v10.txt]5449

A dirty road serves when it makes for the goal
Age when usually even bad liquor tastes of honey
An admirer of the lovely color of his blue bruises
Ardently they desire that which transcends sense
Ask for what is feasible
Bearers of ill ride faster than the messengers of weal
Blossom of the thorny wreath of sorrow
Called his daughter to wash his feet
Colored cakes in the shape of beasts
Deficient are as guilty in their eyes as the idle
Desert is a wonderful physician for a sick soul
Do not spoil the future for the sake of the present
Drink of the joys of life thankfully, and in moderation
Every misfortune brings its fellow with it
Exhibit one's happiness in the streets, and conceal one's misery
Eyes kind and frank, without tricks of glance
For fear of the toothache, had his sound teeth drawn
Hatred for all that hinders the growth of light
Hatred between man and man
He is clever and knows everything, but how silly he looks now
He who looks for faith must give faith
Her white cat was playing at her feet
How easy it is to give wounds, and how hard it is to heal
How tender is thy severity
Human sacrifices, which had been introduced into Egypt by the Phoenicians
I know that I am of use
I have never deviated from the exact truth even in jest
If it were right we should not want to hide ourselves
Impartial looker-on sees clearer than the player
It is not seeing, it is seeking that is delightful
Judge only by appearances, and never enquire into the causes
Kisra called wine the soap of sorrow
Learn early to pass lightly over little things
Learn to obey, that later you may know how to command
Like the cackle of hens, which is peculiar to Eastern women
Man has nothing harder to endure than uncertainty
Many creditors are so many allies
Medicines work harm as often as good
Money is a pass-key that turns any lock
No good excepting that from which we expect the worst
No one so self-confident and insolent as just such an idiot
None of us really know anything rightly
Obstinacy--which he liked to call firm determination
Often happens that apparent superiority does us damage
One falsehood usually entails another
One should give nothing up for lost excepting the dead
Only the choice between lying and silence
Our thinkers are no heroes, and our heroes are no sages
Overbusy friends are more damaging than intelligent enemies
Patronizing friendliness
Prepare sorrow when we come into the world
Principle of over-estimating the strength of our opponents
Provide yourself with a self-devised ruler
Refreshed by the whip of one of the horsemen
Repugnance for the old laws began to take root in his heart
Seditious words are like sparks, which are borne by the wind
Successes, like misfortunes, never come singly
The beginning of things is not more attractive
The scholar's ears are at his back: when he is flogged
The man within him, and not on the circumstances without
The dressing and undressing of the holy images
The experienced love to signify their superiority
The mother of foresight looks backwards
Think of his wife, not with affection only, but with pride
Those whom we fear, says my uncle, we cannot love
Thou canst say in words what we can only feel
Thought that the insane were possessed by demons
Title must not be a bill of fare
Trustfulness is so dear, so essential to me
Use words instead of swords, traps instead of lances
We quarrel with no one more readily than with the benefactor
Whether the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief
Youth should be modest, and he was assertive

Did the ancients know anything of love
Folly to fret over what cannot be undone
Go down into the grave before us (Our children)
He who kills a cat is punished (for murder)
In those days men wept, as well as women
Lovers delighted in nature then as now
Multitude who, like the gnats, fly towards every thing brilliant
Olympics--The first was fixed 776 B.C.
Papyrus Ebers
Pious axioms to be repeated by the physician, while compounding
Romantic love, as we know it, a result of Christianity
True host puts an end to the banquet
Whether the historical romance is ever justifiable




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v2  [GE#13][ge13v10.txt]5451

Avoid excessive joy as well as complaining grief
Cast off all care; be mindful only of pleasure
Creed which views life as a short pilgrimage to the grave
Does happiness consist then in possession
Happiness has nothing to do with our outward circumstances
In our country it needs more courage to be a coward
Observe a due proportion in all things
One must enjoy the time while it is here
Pilgrimage to the grave, and death as the only true life
Robes cut as to leave the right breast uncovered
The priests are my opponents, my masters
Time is clever in the healing art
We live for life, not for death




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v3  [GE#14][ge14v10.txt]5452

A kind word hath far more power than an angry one
Abuse not those who have outwitted thee
Cannot understand how trifles can make me so happy
Confess I would rather provoke a lioness than a woman
Curiosity is a woman's vice
I cannot .  .  .  Say rather: I will not
In this immense temple man seemed a dwarf in his own eyes
Know how to honor beauty; and prove it by taking many wives
Mosquito-tower with which nearly every house was provided
Natural impulse which moves all old women to favor lovers
Sent for a second interpreter
Sing their libels on women (Greek Philosophers)
Those are not my real friends who tell me I am beautiful
Young Greek girls pass their sad childhood in close rooms




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v4  [GE#15][ge15v10.txt]5453

A first impression is often a final one
Assigned sixty years as the limit of a happy life
At my age every year must be accepted as an undeserved gift
Cambyses had been spoiled from his earliest infancy
Devoid of occupation, envy easily becomes hatred
Easy to understand what we like to hear
Eros mocks all human efforts to resist or confine him
Eyes are much more eloquent than all the tongues in the world
For the errors of the wise the remedy is reparation, not regret
Greeks have not the same reverence for truth
He who is to govern well must begin by learning to obey
In war the fathers live to mourn for their slain sons
Inn, was to be found about every eighteen miles
Lovers are the most unteachable of pupils
The beautiful past is all he has to live upon
The gods cast envious glances at the happiness of mortals
Unwise to try to make a man happy by force
War is a perversion of nature
Ye play with eternity as if it were but a passing moment
Zeus pays no heed to lovers' oaths




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v5  [GE#16][ge16v10.txt]5454

Death is so long and life so short

Take heed lest pride degenerate into vainglory




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v6  [GE#17][ge17v10.txt]5455

Call everything that is beyond your comprehension a miracle
Never so clever as when we have to find excuses for our own sins
So long as we are able to hope and wish




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v7  [GE#18][ge18v10.txt]5456

Blessings go as quickly as they come
Hast thou a wounded heart? touch it seldom
Nothing is perfectly certain in this world
Only two remedies for heart-sickness:--hope and patience
Remember, a lie and your death are one and the same
Scarcely be able to use so large a sum--Then abuse it
Whatever a man would do himself, he thinks others are capable of
When love has once taken firm hold of a man in riper years




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v8  [GE#19][ge19v10.txt]5457

Corpse to be torn in pieces by dogs and vultures
He is the best host, who allows his guests the most freedom
The past belongs to the dead; only fools count upon the future
They praise their butchers more than their benefactors
We've talked a good deal of love with our eyes already
Wise men hold fast by the ever young present




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v9  [GE#20][ge20v10.txt]5458

Between two stools a man falls to the ground
Human beings hate the man who shows kindness to their enemies
Misfortune too great for tears
Nothing is more dangerous to love, than a comfortable assurance
Ordered his feet to be washed and his head anointed
Rules of life given by one man to another are useless




AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,  by Georg Ebers, v10 [GE#21][ge21v10.txt]5459

A noble mind can never swim with the stream
Age is inquisitive
Apis the progeny of a virgin cow and a moonbeam
Be not merciful unto him who is a liar or a rebel
Canal to connect the Nile with the Red Sea
I was not swift to anger, nor a liar, nor a violent ruler
Introduced a regular system of taxation--(Darius)
Numbers are the only certain things
Resistance always brings out a man's best powers

THE SISTERS,           by Georg Ebers, v1  [GE#23][ge23v10.txt]5461

A mere nothing in one man's life, to another may be great
A subdued tone generally provokes an equally subdued answer
Air of a professional guide
Before you serve me up so bitter a meal (the truth)
Blind tenderness which knows no reason
By nature she is not and by circumstances is compelled to be
Deceit is deceit
Desire to seek and find a power outside us
Inquisitive eyes are intrusive company
Many a one would rather be feared than remain unheeded
Not yet fairly come to the end of yesterday
The altar where truth is mocked at
Virtues are punished in this world
Who can be freer than he who needs nothing
Who only puts on his armor when he is threatened




THE SISTERS,           by Georg Ebers, v2  [GE#24][ge24v10.txt]5462

And what is great--and what is small
Behold, the puny Child of Man
Evolution and annihilation
Flattery is a key to the heart
Hold pleasure to be the highest good
Man is the measure of all things
Museum of Alexandria and the Library
One hand washes the other
Prefer deeds to words
What are we all but puny children?




THE SISTERS,           by Georg Ebers, v3  [GE#25][ge25v10.txt]5463

THE SISTERS,           by Georg Ebers, v4  [GE#26][ge26v10.txt]5464

Created the world out of nothing for no other purpose
Dreamless sleep after a day brimful of enjoyment
Man must subjugate matter and not become subject to it
No one believes anything that can diminish his self-esteem
Praise out of all proportion to our merit
Save them the trouble of thinking for themselves
She no longer thought these things--she was possessed by them
Taken it upon herself to be always strong, and self-reliant
The most terrible of all the gods, are women
The sun seems to move too slowly to those who long and wait
We seek for truth; the Jews believe they possess it entirely
Who always think at second-hand
Why so vehement, sister?  So much zeal is quite unnecessary

A school where people learned modesty
But what do you men care for the suffering you inflict on others
Childhood already lies behind me, and youth will soon follow
Good advice is more frequently unheeded than followed
Precepts and lessons which only a mother can give
Should I be a man, if I forgot vengeance?
To the mines meant to be doomed to a slow, torturing death
What had formerly afforded me pleasure now seemed shallow

Most ready to be angry with those to whom we have been unjust

To govern the world one must have less need of sleep
Trouble does not enhance beauty
Until neither knew which was the giver and which the receiver
What changes so quickly as joy and sorrow
Without heeding the opinion of mortals
Zeus does not hear the vows of lovers




THE EMPEROR,           by Georg Ebers, v1  [GE#45][ge45v10.txt]5483

Facts are differently reflected in different minds
Have not yet learned not to be astonished
Ill-judgment to pronounce a thing impossible
Years are the foe of beauty




THE EMPEROR,           by Georg Ebers, v2  [GE#46][ge46v10.txt]5484

A well-to-do man always gets a higher price than a poor one
I must either rest or begin upon something new

THE EMPEROR,           by Georg Ebers, v4  [GE#48][ge48v10.txt]5486

Enjoy the present day
Idleness had long since grown to be the occupation of his life
It was such a comfort once more to obey an order
Philosophers who wrote of the vanity of writers




THE EMPEROR,           by Georg Ebers, v5  [GE#49][ge49v10.txt]5487

Avoid all useless anxiety
To know half is less endurable than to know nothing
Who do all they are able and enjoy as much as they can get




THE EMPEROR,           by Georg Ebers, v6  [GE#50][ge50v10.txt]5488

Happiness is only the threshold to misery
When a friend refuses to share in joys




THE EMPEROR,           by Georg Ebers, v7  [GE#51][ge51v10.txt]5489

Dried merry-thought bone of a fowl
More to the purpose to think of the future than of the past
So long as we do not think ourselves wretched, we are not so
Temples would be empty if mortals had nothing left to wish for




THE EMPEROR,           by Georg Ebers, v8  [GE#52][ge52v10.txt]5490

HOMO SUM,              by Georg Ebers, v1  [GE#56][ge56v10.txt]5494

Action trod on the heels of resolve
Homo sum; humani nil a me alienum puto
I am human, nothing that is human can I regard as alien to me
Love is at once the easiest and the most difficult
Love overlooks the ravages of years and has a good memory
No judgment is so hard as that dealt by a slave to slaves
No man is more than man, and many men are less
Sky as bare of cloud as the rocks are of shrubs and herbs
Sleep avoided them both, and each knew that the other was awake
The older one grows the quicker the hours hurry away
To pray is better than to bathe
Wakefulness may prolong the little term of life




HOMO SUM,              by Georg Ebers, v2  [GE#57][ge57v10.txt]5495

Christian hypocrites who pretend to hate life and love death
He may talk about the soul--what he is after is the girl
Love means suffering--those who love drag a chain with them
To her it was not a belief but a certainty
Trifling incident gains importance when undue emphasis is laid

Perish all those who do not think as we do
Reason is a feeble weapon in contending with a woman

Cast my warning to the winds, pity will also fly away with it
Must--that word is a ploughshare which suits only loose soil
Tender and uncouth natural sounds, which no language knows
There is nothing better than death, for it is peace
Tone of patronizing instruction assumed by the better informed
Wait, child!  What is life but waiting?




ARACHNE,               by Georg Ebers, v2  [GE#70][ge70v10.txt]5509

Nature is sufficient for us
There are no gods, and whoever bows makes himself a slave

THE BRIDE OF THE NILE, by Georg Ebers, v1  [GE#78][ge78v10.txt]5517

Abandon to the young the things we ourselves used most to enjoy
Spoilt to begin with by their mothers, and then all the women
Talk of the wolf and you see his tail
Temples of the old gods were used as quarries
Women are indeed the rock ahead in this young fellow's life




THE BRIDE OF THE NILE, by Georg Ebers, v2  [GE#79][ge79v10.txt]5518

Ancient custom, to have her ears cut off
Caught the infection and had to laugh whether she would or no
Gave them a claim on your person and also on your sorrows
How could they find so much pleasure in such folly
Of two evils it is wise to choose the lesser
Prepared for the worst; then you are armed against failure
Who can hope to win love that gives none
Who can take pleasure in always seeing a gloomy face?




THE BRIDE OF THE NILE, by Georg Ebers, v3  [GE#80][ge80v10.txt]5519

Love has two faces: tender devotion and bitter aversion
Self-interest and egoism which drive him into the cave
The man who avoids his kind and lives in solitude
You have a habit of only looking backwards




THE BRIDE OF THE NILE, by Georg Ebers, v4  [GE#81][ge81v10.txt]5520

Life is not a banquet




THE BRIDE OF THE NILE, by Georg Ebers, v5  [GE#82][ge82v10.txt]5521

Gratitude is a tribute on which no wise man ever reckons
Healthy soul is only to be found in a healthy body
Man is the standard of all things
Persians never prayed for any particular blessing
The immortal gods have set sweat before virtue
Things you mean are only what they seem to us
Would want some one else to wear herself out for
Any woman can forgive any man for his audacity in loving her




THE BRIDE OF THE NILE, by Georg Ebers, v6  [GE#83][ge83v10.txt]5522

A knot can often be untied by daylight
Hatred and love are the opposite ends of the same rod
Life is a function, a ministry, a duty
So hard is it to forego the right of hating
Those who will not listen must feel
Use their physical helplessness as a defence




THE BRIDE OF THE NILE, by Georg Ebers, v7  [GE#84][ge84v10.txt]5523

MARGERY,               by Georg Ebers, v1 [GE#113][g113v10.txt]5552

As every word came straight from her heart
Be cautious how they are compassionate
Beware lest Satan find thee idle!
Brought imagination to bear on my pastimes
Comparing their own fair lot with the evil lot of others
Faith and knowledge are things apart
Flee from hate as the soul's worst foe
For the sake of those eyes you forgot all else
Her eyes were like open windows
Last Day we shall be called to account for every word we utter
Laugh at him with friendly mockery, such as hurts no man
Maid who gives hope to a suitor though she has no mind to hear
May they avoid the rocks on which I have bruised my feet
Men folks thought more about me than I deemed convenient
No man gains profit by any experience other than his own
One of those women who will not bear to be withstood
The god Amor is the best schoolmaster
They who will, can
When men-children deem maids to be weak and unfit for true sport




MARGERY,               by Georg Ebers, v2 [GE#114][g114v10.txt]5553

Be happy while it is yet time
Germans are ever proud of a man who is able to drink deep
On with a new love when he had left the third bridge behind him
The not over-strong thread of my good patience
Vagabond knaves had already been put to the torture




MARGERY,               by Georg Ebers, v3 [GE#115][g115v10.txt]5554

A small joy makes us to forget our heavy griefs
All I did was right in her eyes
Especial gift to listen keenly and question discreetly
Happiness should be found in making others happy
Have never been fain to set my heart on one only maid
Hopeful soul clings to delay as the harbinger of deliverance
No false comfort, no cloaking of the truth
One Head, instead of three, ruled the Church
Though thou lose all thou deemest thy happiness




MARGERY,               by Georg Ebers, v4 [GE#116][g116v10.txt]5555

Forty or fifty, when most women only begin to be wicked
Shadow which must ever fall where there is light
Woman who might win the love of a highly-gifted soul (Pays for it)




MARGERY,               by Georg Ebers, v7 [GE#119][g119v10.txt]5558

Marred their best joy in life by over-hasty ire
Misfortunes never come singly




MARGERY,               by Georg Ebers, v8 [GE#120][g120v10.txt]5559

Ever creep in where true love hath found a nest--(jealousy)
One who stood in the sun must need cast a shadow on other folks
We each and all are waiting




MARGERY,               by Ebers, Complete [GE#121][g121v10.txt]5560

A small joy makes us to forget our heavy griefs
All I did was right in her eyes
All things were alike to me
As every word came straight from her heart
Be cautious how they are compassionate
Be happy while it is yet time
Beware lest Satan find thee idle!
Brought imagination to bear on my pastimes
Comparing their own fair lot with the evil lot of others
Especial gift to listen keenly and question discreetly
Ever creep in where true love hath found a nest--(jealousy)
Faith and knowledge are things apart
Flee from hate as the soul's worst foe
For the sake of those eyes you forgot all else
Forty or fifty, when most women only begin to be wicked
Fruits and pies and sweetmeats for the little ones at home
Germans are ever proud of a man who is able to drink deep
Happiness should be found in making others happy
Have never been fain to set my heart on one only maid
Her eyes were like open windows
Hopeful soul clings to delay as the harbinger of deliverance
Last Day we shall be called to account for every word we utter
Laugh at him with friendly mockery, such as hurts no man
Love which is able and ready to endure all things
Maid who gives hope to a suitor though she has no mind to hear
Marred their best joy in life by over-hasty ire
May they avoid the rocks on which I have bruised my feet
Men folks thought more about me than I deemed convenient
Misfortunes never come singly
No man gains profit by any experience other than his own
No false comfort, no cloaking of the truth
On with a new love when he had left the third bridge behind him
One Head, instead of three, ruled the Church
One who stood in the sun must need cast a shadow on other folks
One of those women who will not bear to be withstood
Shadow which must ever fall where there is light
The god Amor is the best schoolmaster
The not over-strong thread of my good patience
They who will, can
Though thou lose all thou deemest thy happiness
Vagabond knaves had already been put to the torture
We each and all are waiting
Were we not one and all born fools
When men-children deem maids to be weak and unfit for true sport
Woman who might win the love of a highly-gifted soul (Pays for it)
Wonder we leave for the most part to children and fools

A live dog is better than a dead king
Always more good things in a poor family which was once rich
Harder it is to win a thing the higher its value becomes

BURGOMASTER'S WIFE,    by Georg Ebers, v1 [GE#139][g139v10.txt]5578

A blustering word often does good service

A QUESTION,            by Georg Ebers,    [GE#149][g149v10.txt]5588

Absence of suffering is not happiness
Laughing before sunrise causes tears at evening
People see what they want to see
Seems most charming at the time we are obliged to resign it
Wrath has two eyes--one blind, the other keener than a falcon's




THE ELIXIR,            by Georg Ebers,    [GE#150][g150v10.txt]5589

Caress or a spank from you--each at the proper time
Clothes the ugly truth as with a pleasing garment
Couple seemed to get on so perfectly well without them
Death itself sometimes floats 'twixt cup and lip'
Exceptional people are destined to be unhappy in this world
If speech be silver, silence then is gold!




THE GREYLOCK,          by Georg Ebers,    [GE#151][g151v10.txt]5590

At my age we count it gain not to be disappointed
Had laid aside what we call nerves
Like a clock that points to one hour while it strikes another
To-morrow could give them nothing better than to-day

Life is the fairest fairy tale (Anderson)
Life is valued so much less by the young
Life had fulfilled its pledges
Like the cackle of hens, which is peculiar to Eastern women
Like a clock that points to one hour while it strikes another
Love has two faces: tender devotion and bitter aversion
Love means suffering--those who love drag a chain with them
Love which is able and ready to endure all things
Love laughs at locksmiths
Love is at once the easiest and the most difficult
Love overlooks the ravages of years and has a good memory
Loved himself too much to give his whole affection to any one
Lovers delighted in nature then as now
Lovers are the most unteachable of pupils
Maid who gives hope to a suitor though she has no mind to hear
Man, in short, could be sure of nothing
Man works with all his might for no one but himself
Man is the measure of all things
Man has nothing harder to endure than uncertainty
Many creditors are so many allies
Many a one would rather be feared than remain unheeded
Marred their best joy in life by over-hasty ire
May they avoid the rocks on which I have bruised my feet
Medicines work harm as often as good
Men studying for their own benefit, not the teacher's
Men folks thought more about me than I deemed convenient
Mirrors were not allowed in the convent
Misfortune too great for tears
Misfortunes commonly come in couples yoked like oxen
Misfortunes never come singly
Money is a pass-key that turns any lock
More to the purpose to think of the future than of the past
Mosquito-tower with which nearly every house was provided
Most ready to be angry with those to whom we have been unjust
Multitude who, like the gnats, fly towards every thing brilliant
Museum of Alexandria and the Library
Must take care not to poison the fishes with it
Must--that word is a ploughshare which suits only loose soil
Natural impulse which moves all old women to favor lovers
Nature is sufficient for us
Never speaks a word too much or too little
Never so clever as when we have to find excuses for our own sins
Never to be astonished at anything
No judgment is so hard as that dealt by a slave to slaves
No man is more than man, and many men are less
No man was allowed to ask anything of the gods for himself
No good excepting that from which we expect the worst
No,  she was not created to grow old
No happiness will thrive on bread and water
No one we learn to hate more easily, than the benefactor
No man gains profit by any experience other than his own
No false comfort, no cloaking of the truth
No one so self-confident and insolent as just such an idiot
No virtue which can be owned like a house or a steed
Nobody was allowed to be perfectly idle
None of us really know anything rightly
Not yet fairly come to the end of yesterday
Nothing in life is either great or small
Nothing is perfectly certain in this world
Nothing permanent but change
Nothing so certain as that nothing is certain
Nothing is more dangerous to love, than a comfortable assurance
Numbers are the only certain things
Observe a due proportion in all things
Obstacles existed only to be removed
Obstinacy--which he liked to call firm determination
Of two evils it is wise to choose the lesser
Often happens that apparent superiority does us damage
Old women grow like men, and old men grow like women
Old age no longer forgets; it is youth that has a short memory
Olympics--The first was fixed 776 B.C.
Omnipotent God, who had preferred his race above all others
On with a new love when he had left the third bridge behind him
Once laughed at a misfortune, its sting loses its point
One falsehood usually entails another
One of those women who will not bear to be withstood
One should give nothing up for lost excepting the dead
One hand washes the other
One must enjoy the time while it is here
One who stood in the sun must need cast a shadow on other folks
One Head, instead of three, ruled the Church
Only the choice between lying and silence
Only two remedies for heart-sickness:--hope and patience
Ordered his feet to be washed and his head anointed
Our thinkers are no heroes, and our heroes are no sages
Overbusy friends are more damaging than intelligent enemies
Overlooks his own fault in his feeling of the judge's injustice
Ovid, 'We praise the ancients'
Pain is the inseparable companion of love
Papyrus Ebers
Patronizing friendliness
Pays better to provide for people's bodies than for their brains
People who have nothing to do always lack time
People see what they want to see
Perish all those who do not think as we do
Philosophers who wrote of the vanity of writers
Phrase and idea "philosophy of religion" as an absurdity
Pilgrimage to the grave, and death as the only true life
Pious axioms to be repeated by the physician, while compounding
Pleasant sensation of being a woman, like any other woman
Possess little and require nothing
Pray for me, a miserable man--for I was a man
Precepts and lessons which only a mother can give
Prefer deeds to words
Preferred a winding path to a straight one
Prepare sorrow when we come into the world
Prepared for the worst; then you are armed against failure
Pretended to see nothing in the old woman's taunts
Priests that they should instruct the people to be obedient
Priests: in order to curb the unruly conduct of the populace
Principle of over-estimating the strength of our opponents
Provide yourself with a self-devised ruler
Rapture and anguish--who can lay down the border line
Readers often like best what is most incredible
Reason is a feeble weapon in contending with a woman
Refreshed by the whip of one of the horsemen
Regard the utterances and mandates of age as wisdom
Regular messenger and carrier-dove service had been established
Remember, a lie and your death are one and the same
Repeated the exclamation: "Too late!"  and again, "Too late!
Repos ailleurs
Repugnance for the old laws began to take root in his heart
Required courage to be cowardly
Resistance always brings out a man's best powers
Retreat behind the high-sounding words "justice and law"
Robes cut as to leave the right breast uncovered
Romantic love, as we know it, a result of Christianity
Rules of life given by one man to another are useless
Scarcely be able to use so large a sum--Then abuse it
Scorned the censure of the people, he never lost sight of it
Sea-port was connected with Medina by a pigeon-post
Seditious words are like sparks, which are borne by the wind
See facts as they are and treat them like figures in a sum
Seems most charming at the time we are obliged to resign it
Self-interest and egoism which drive him into the cave
Sent for a second interpreter
Shadow which must ever fall where there is light
Shadow of the candlestick caught her eye before the light
She would not purchase a few more years of valueless life
Shipwrecked on the cliffs of 'better' and 'best'
Should I be a man, if I forgot vengeance?
Shuns the downward glance of compassion
Sing their libels on women (Greek Philosophers)
Sky as bare of cloud as the rocks are of shrubs and herbs
Sleep avoided them both, and each knew that the other was awake
Smell most powerful of all the senses in awakening memory
So long as we are able to hope and wish
So long as we do not think ourselves wretched, we are not so
So hard is it to forego the right of hating
Some caution is needed even in giving a warning
Soul which ceases to regard death as a misfortune finds peace
Speaking ill of others is their greatest delight
Spoilt to begin with by their mothers, and then all the women
Standing still is retrograding
Strongest of all educational powers--sorrow and love
Successes, like misfortunes, never come singly
Take heed lest pride degenerate into vainglory
Talk of the wolf and you see his tail
Temples would be empty if mortals had nothing left to wish for
Temples of the old gods were used as quarries
Tender and uncouth natural sounds, which no language knows
That tears were the best portion of all human life
The heart must not be filled by another's image
The blessing of those who are more than they seem
The past belongs to the dead; only fools count upon the future
The priests are my opponents, my masters
The carp served on Christmas eve in every Berlin family
The gods cast envious glances at the happiness of mortals
The past must stand; it is like a scar
The man who avoids his kind and lives in solitude
The beautiful past is all he has to live upon
The altar where truth is mocked at
The older one grows the quicker the hours hurry away
The shirt is closer than the coat
The beginning of things is not more attractive
The mother of foresight looks backwards
The greatness he had gained he overlooked
The dressing and undressing of the holy images
The god Amor is the best schoolmaster
The not over-strong thread of my good patience
The man within him, and not on the circumstances without
The scholar's ears are at his back: when he is flogged
The best enjoyment in creating is had in anticipation
The experienced love to signify their superiority
Then hate came; but it did not last long
There is no 'never,' no surely
There are no gods, and whoever bows makes himself a slave
There is nothing better than death, for it is peace
They who will, can
They praise their butchers more than their benefactors
They keep an account in their heart and not in their head
They get ahead of us, and yet--I would not change with them
Thin-skinned, like all up-starts in authority
Think of his wife, not with affection only, but with pride
Those are not my real friends who tell me I am beautiful
Those who will not listen must feel
Those two little words 'wish' and 'ought'
Those whom we fear, says my uncle, we cannot love
Thou canst say in words what we can only feel
Though thou lose all thou deemest thy happiness
Thought that the insane were possessed by demons
Time is clever in the healing art
Title must not be a bill of fare
To pray is better than to bathe
To govern the world one must have less need of sleep
To know half is less endurable than to know nothing
To her it was not a belief but a certainty
To the child death is only slumber
To expect gratitude is folly
To the mines meant to be doomed to a slow, torturing death
To whom the emotion of sorrow affords a mournful pleasure
To whom fortune gives once, it gives by bushels
To-morrow could give them nothing better than to-day
To be happy, one must forget what cannot be altered
Tone of patronizing instruction assumed by the better informed
Trifling incident gains importance when undue emphasis is laid
Trouble does not enhance beauty
True host puts an end to the banquet
Trustfulness is so dear, so essential to me
Two griefs always belong to one joy
Unjust to injure and rob the child for the benefit of the man
Until neither knew which was the giver and which the receiver
Unwise to try to make a man happy by force
Use their physical helplessness as a defence
Use words instead of swords, traps instead of lances
Usually found the worst wine in the taverns with showy signs
Vagabond knaves had already been put to the torture
Very hard to imagine nothingness
Virtues are punished in this world
Voice of the senses, which drew them together, will soon be mute
Wait, child!  What is life but waiting?
Waiting is the merchant's wisdom
Wakefulness may prolong the little term of life
War is a perversion of nature
We live for life, not for death
We quarrel with no one more readily than with the benefactor
We each and all are waiting
We've talked a good deal of love with our eyes already
Welcome a small evil when it barred the way to a greater one
Were we not one and all born fools
Wet inside, he can bear a great deal of moisture without
What had formerly afforded me pleasure now seemed shallow
What changes so quickly as joy and sorrow
What are we all but puny children?
What father does not find something to admire in his child
Whatever a man would do himself, he thinks others are capable of
When love has once taken firm hold of a man in riper years
When a friend refuses to share in joys
When men-children deem maids to be weak and unfit for true sport
When hate and revenge speak, gratitude shrinks timidly
When you want to strike me again, mother, please take off
Whether the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief
Whether man were the best or the worst of created beings
Whether the historical romance is ever justifiable
Who watches for his neighbour's faults has a hundred sharp eyes
Who can point out the road that another will take
Who can be freer than he who needs nothing
Who only puts on his armor when he is threatened
Who does not struggle ward, falls back
Who gives great gifts, expects great gifts again
Who do all they are able and enjoy as much as they can get
Who can take pleasure in always seeing a gloomy face?
Who can prop another's house when his own is falling
Who can hope to win love that gives none
Whoever condemns, feels himself superior
Whoever will not hear, must feel
Wide world between the purpose and the deed
Wise men hold fast by the ever young present
Without heeding the opinion of mortals
Woman who might win the love of a highly-gifted soul (Pays for it)
Woman's disapproving words were blown away by the wind
Woman's hair is long, but her wit is short
Women are indeed the rock ahead in this young fellow's life
Wonder we leave for the most part to children and fools
Words that sounded kindly, but with a cold, unloving heart
Wrath has two eyes--one blind, the other keener than a falcon's
Ye play with eternity as if it were but a passing moment
Years are the foe of beauty
You have a habit of only looking backwards
Young Greek girls pass their sad childhood in close rooms
Youth should be modest, and he was assertive
Youth calls 'much,' what seems to older people 'little'
Zeus does not hear the vows of lovers
Zeus pays no heed to lovers' oaths





*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK QUOTATIONS OF GEORG EBERS, BY WIDGER ***

************ This file should be named 6126.txt or 6126.zip *************

This eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
