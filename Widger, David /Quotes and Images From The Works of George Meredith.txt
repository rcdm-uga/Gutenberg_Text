and worry

indiscretion

A cloud of millinery shoots me off a
mile from a woman

A woman's at the core of every plot man
plotteth

A witty woman is a treasure; a witty
Beauty is a power

A high wind will make a dead leaf fly
like a bird

A kindly sense of superiority

A young philosopher's an old fool!

A bird that won't roast or boil or stew

A woman, and would therefore listen to
nonsense

A male devotee is within an inch of a
miracle

A great oration may be a sedative

A very doubtful benefit

wrong side

to her your plans

A woman who has mastered sauces sits on
the apex of civilization

the wise youth

A maker of Proverbs--what is he but a
narrow mind wit

A fortress face; strong and massive,
and honourable in ruin

A common age once, when he married her;
now she had grown old

despised

circumference

Above all things I detest the writing
for money

Above Nature, I tell him, or, we shall
be very much below

Absolute freedom could be the worst of
perils

Accidents are the specific for averting
the maladies of age

Accounting his tight blue tail coat and
brass buttons a victory

Accounting for it, is not the same as
excusing

Accustomed to be paid for by his
country

Acting is not of the high class which
conceals the art

Active despair is a passion that must
be superseded

Add on a tired pipe after dark, and a
sound sleep to follow

Adept in the lie implied

borrower

Admiration of an enemy or oppressor
doing great deeds

woman or widow in sight

won from fear

All passed too swift for happiness

all

All that Matey and Browny were
forbidden to write they looked

All are friends who sit at table

All flattery is at somebody's expense

Allowed silly sensitiveness to prevent
the repair

Although it blew hard when Caesar
crossed the Rubicon

Always the shout for more produced it
("News")

Am I ill?  I must be hungry!

Am I thy master, or thou mine?

Americans forgivingly remember, without
mentioning

Amiable mirror as being wilfully
ruffled to confuse

chivalrous codes

slaughter

must be

bottom and at the top

bargain)

match my wife at home

And to these instructions he gave an
aim: "First be virtuous"

And not be beaten by an acknowledged
defeat

life

And life said, Do it, and death said,
To what end?

the amusement

knee for nothing

measures

not hear of convictions

weaker

of an English audience

for war

clumsiness

As secretive as they are sensitive

As well ask (women) how a battle-field
concerns them!

swears by them

previously enunciate the formula

As little trouble as the heath when the
woods are swept

As if the age were the injury!

As for titles, the way to defend them
is to be worthy of them

As fair play as a woman's lord could
give her

As for comparisons, they are flowers
thrown into the fire

As in all great oratory!  The key of it
is the pathos

As becomes them, they do not look ahead

Ashamed of letting his ears be filled
with secret talk

myself

Good maxim for the wrathful--speak not
at all

Good jokes are not always good policy

Goodish sort of fellow; good horseman,
good shot, good character

Gossip always has some solid
foundation, however small

Government of brain; not sufficient
Insurrection of heart

Gradations appear to be unknown to you

Graduated naturally enough the finer
stages of self-deception

Grand air of pitying sadness

Gratitude never was a woman's gift

Gratuitous insult

Gravely reproaching the tobacconist for
the growing costliness of cigars

Greater our successes, the greater the
slaves we become

Greatest of men; who have to learn from
the loss of the woman

Grief of an ill-fortuned passion of his
youth

Grimaces at a government long-nosed to
no purpose

Grossly unlike in likeness (portraits)

Habit had legalized his union with her

Habit of antedating his sagacity

Habit, what a sacred and admirable
thing it is

Had got  the trick of lying, through
fear of telling the truth

Had come to be her lover through being
her husband

Had Shakespeare's grandmother three
Christian names?

Had taken refuge in their opera-glasses

Half-truth that we may put on the mask
of the whole

Half a dozen dozen left

Half designingly permitted her trouble
to be seen

Happiness in love is a match between
ecstasy and compliance

Happy the woman who has not more to
speak

Happy in privation and suffering if
simply we can accept beauty

Hard to bear, at times unbearable

Hard enough for a man to be married to
a fool

Hard men have sometimes a warm
affection for dogs

Haremed opinion of the unfitness of
women

Hated one thing alone--which was
'bother'

Hated tears, considering them a clog to
all useful machinery

Hates a compromise

Haunted many pillows

Have her profile very frequently while
I am conversing with her

Having contracted the fatal habit of
irony

He was not alive for his own pleasure

He, by insisting, made me a rebel

He bowed to facts

He grunted that a lying clock was
hateful to him

He has been tolerably honest, Tom, for
a man and a lover

He kept saying to himself, 'to-morrow I
will tell'

He postponed it to the next minute and
the next

He prattled, in the happy ignorance of
compulsion

He was in love, and subtle love will
not be shamed and smothered

He thinks that the country must be
saved by its women as well

He is in the season of faults

He had his character to maintain

He squandered the guineas, she
patiently picked up the pence

He neared her, wooing her; and she
assented

He judged of others by himself

He is inexorable, being the guilty one
of the two

He had to shake up wrath over his
grievances

He had gone, and the day lived again
for both of them

He gave a slight sign of restiveness,
and was allowed to go

He loathed a skulker

He clearly could not learn from
misfortune

He thinks or he chews

He would neither retort nor defend
himself

He whipped himself up to one of his
oratorical frenzies

He put no question to anybody

He took small account of the operations
of the feelings

He began ambitiously--It's the way at
the beginning

He never explained

He never acknowledged a trouble, he
dispersed it

He was the prisoner of his word

He wants the whip; ought to have had it
regularly

He had wealth for a likeness of
strength

He was a figure on a horse, and naught
when off it

He did not vastly respect beautiful
women

He sinks terribly when he sinks at all

He was not a weaver of phrases in
distress

He lies as naturally as an infant sucks

He tried to gather his ideas, but the
effort was like that of a light dreamer

He runs too much from first principles
to extremes

He gained much by claiming little

He had by nature a tarnishing eye that
cast discolouration

He was too much on fire to know the
taste of absurdity

He smoked,  Lord Avonley said of the
second departure

He had no recollection of having ever
dined without drinking wine

He stormed her and consented to be
beaten

He will be a part of every history (the
fool)

He was the maddest of tyrants--a weak
one

He had to go, he must, he has to be
always going

He never calculated on the happening of
mortal accidents

He had expected romance, and had met
merchandize

He condensed a paragraph into a line

He lost the art of observing himself

He had neat phrases, opinions in
packets

He's good from end to end, and beats a
Christian hollow (a hog)

Hear victorious lawlessness appealing
solemnly to God the law

Heart to keep guard and bury the bones
you tossed him

Heartily she thanked the girl for the
excuse to cry

Hearts that make one soul do not
separately count their gifts

Heathen vindictiveness declaring itself
holy

Heights of humour beyond laughter

Her intimacy with a man old enough to
be her grandfather

Her vehement fighting against facts

Her peculiar tenacity of the sense of
injury

Her feelings--trustier guides than her
judgement in this crisis

Her final impression likened him to a
house locked up and empty

Her aspect suggested the repose of a
winter landscape

Her singing struck a note of grateful
remembered delight

Her duel with Time

Here, where he both wished and wished
not to be

Here and there a plain good soul to
whom he was affectionate

Hermits enamoured of wind and rain

Hero embarked in the redemption of an
erring beautiful woman

Heroine, in common with the hero, has
her ambition to be of use

Herself, content to be dull if he might
shine

Hesitating strangeness that sometimes
gathers during absences

Himself in the worn old surplice of the
converted rake

His aim to win the woman acknowledged
no obstacle in the means

His idea of marriage is, the taking of
the woman into custody

His gaze and one of his ears, if not
the pair, were given

His ridiculous equanimity

His alien ideas were not unimpressed by
the picture

His restored sense of possession

His wife alone, had, as they termed it,
kept him together

His equanimity was fictitious

His fancy performed miraculous feats

His violent earnestness, his imperial
self-confidence

His apparent cynicism is sheer
irritability

Holding to the refusal, for the sake of
consistency

Holding to his work after the strain's
over--That tells the man

Holy images, and other miraculous
objects are sold

Honest creatures who will not accept a
lift from fiction

Hope which lies in giving men a dose of
hysterics

Hopeless task of defending a woman from
a woman

Hopes of a coming disillusion that
would restore him

Hosts of men are of the simple order of
the comic

How angry I should be with you if you
were not so beautiful!

How Success derides Ambition!

How many degrees from love gratitude
may be

How immensely nature seems to prefer
men to women!

How little a thing serves Fortune's
turn

How to compromise the matter for the
sake of peace?

How many instruments cannot clever
women play upon

How little we mean to do harm when we
do an injury

Hug the hatred they packed up among
their bundles

Human nature to feel an interest in the
dog that has bitten you

Humour preserved her from excesses of
sentiment

Huntress with few scruples and the game
unguarded

Hushing together, they agreed that it
had been a false move

I do not defend myself ever

I have learnt as much from light
literature as from heavy

I have and hold--you shall hunger and
covet

I cannot get on with Gibbon

I could be in love with her cruelty, if
only I had her near me

I married a cook  She expects a big
appetite

I want no more, except to be taught to
work

I detest anything that has to do with
gratitude

I know nothing of imagination

I haven't got the pluck of a flea

I hate old age  It changes you so

I would cut my tongue out, if it did
you a service

I can't think brisk out of my breeches

I look on the back of life

I never pay compliments to transparent
merit

I always respected her; I never liked
her

I give my self, I do not sell

I cannot live a life of deceit.  A life
of misery--not deceit

I was discontented, and could not speak
my discontent

I laughed louder than was necessary

I had to cross the park to give a
lesson

I cannot delay; but I request you, that
are here privileged

I ain't a speeder of matrimony

I beg of my husband, and all kind
people who may have the care

I rather like to hear a woman swear.
It embellishes her!

I can confess my sight to be imperfect:
but will you ever do so?

I do not think Frenchmen comparable to
the women of France

I take off my hat, Nan, when I see a
cobbler's stall

I would wait till he flung you off, and
kneel to you

I had to make my father and mother live
on potatoes

I am not ashamed

I hope I am not too hungry to
discriminate

I cannot say less, and will say no more

I wanted a hero

I do not see it, because I will not see
it

I can pay clever gentlemen for doing
Greek for me

I never saw out of a doll-shop, and
never saw there

I 'm the warming pan, as legitimately I
should be

I detest enthusiasm

I baint done yet

I know that your father has been
hearing tales told of me

I never knew till this morning the
force of No in earnest

I hate sleep: I hate anything that robs
me of my will

I have all the luxuries--enough to
loathe them

I who respect the state of marriage by
refusing

I make a point of never recommending my
own house

I like him, I like him, of course, but
I want to breathe

I am a discordant instrument  I do not
readily vibrate

I don't count them against women
(moods)

I 'm a bachelor, and a person--you're
married, and an object

I did, replied Evan.  'I told a lie.'

I never see anything, my dear

I always wait for a thing to happen
first

I'll come as straight as I can

I'm for a rational Deity

I'm in love with everything she wishes!
I've got the habit

Idea is the only vital breath

Ideas in gestation are the dullest
matter you can have

If we are really for Nature, we are not
lawless

If there's no doubt about it, how is it
I have a doubt about it?

If you kneel down, who will decline to
put a foot on you?

If I love you, need you care what
anybody else thinks

If we are to please you rightly, always
allow us to play First

If he had valued you half a grain less,
he might have won you

If the world is hostile we are not to
blame it

If we are robbed, we ask, How came we
by the goods?

If thou wouldst fix remembrance--
thwack!

If I'm struck, I strike back

If only been intellectually a little
flexible in his morality

If you have this creative soul, be the
slave of your creature

If I do not speak of payment

Ignorance roaring behind a mask of
sarcasm

Imagination she has, for a source of
strength in the future days

Immense wealth and native obtuseness
combine to disfigure us

Imparting the usual chorus of yesses to
his own mind

Impossible for him to think that women
thought

Impossible for us women to comprehend
love without folly in man

Impudent boy's fling at superiority
over the superior

In the pay of our doctors

In every difficulty, patience is a
life-belt

In India they sacrifice the widows, in
France the virgins

In bottle if not on draught (oratory)

In our House, my son, there is peculiar
blood.  We go to wreck!

In Sir Austin's Note-book was written:
"Between Simple Boyhood..."

In Italy, a husband away, ze friend
takes title

In truth she sighed to feel as he did,
above everybody

Incapable of putting the screw upon
weak excited nature

Incessantly speaking of the necessity
we granted it unknowingly

Inclined to act hesitation in accepting
the aid she sought

Increase of dissatisfaction with the
more she got

Indirect communication with heaven

Inducement to act the hypocrite before
the hypocrite world

Indulged in their privilege of thinking
what they liked

Infallibility of our august mother

Infants are said to have their ideas,
and why not young ladies?

Infatuated men argue likewise, and
scandal does not move them

Inferences are like shadows on the wall

Inflicted no foretaste of her coming
subjection to him

Informed him that he never played jokes
with money, or on men

Injury forbids us to be friends again

Innocence and uncleanness may go
together

Insistency upon there being two sides
to a case--to every case

Intellectual contempt of easy dupes

Intensely communicative, but
inarticulate

Intentions are really rich possessions

Intimations of cowardice menacing a
paralysis of the will

Intrusion of the spontaneous on the
stereotyped would clash

Intrusion of hard material statements,
facts

Invite indecision to exhaust their
scruples

Ireland 's the sore place of England

Irishman there is a barrow trolling a
load of grievances

Irishmen will never be quite sincere

Ironical fortitude

Irony in him is only eulogy standing on
its head

Irony that seemed to spring from
aversion

Irony instead of eloquence

Irony provoked his laughter more than
fun

Irritability at the intrusion of past
disputes

Is he jealous?  'Only when I make him,
he is.'

Is not one month of brightness as much
as we can ask for?

Is it any waste of time to write of
love?

It 's us hard ones that get on best in
the world

It was harder to be near and not close

It is not high flying, which usually
ends in heavy falling

It is no insignificant contest when
love has to crush self-love

It would be hard!  ay, then we do it
forthwith

It was as if she had been eyeing a
golden door shut fast

It is the best of signs when women take
to her

It was his ill luck to have strong
appetites and a weak stomach

It rarely astonishes our ears  It
illumines our souls

It goes at the lifting of the
bridegroom's little finger

It was an honest buss, but dear at ten
thousand

It is well to learn manners without
having them imposed on us

It was in a time before our joyful era
of universal equality

It is the devil's masterstroke to get
us to accuse him

It was her prayer to heaven that she
might save a doctor's bill

It is better for us both, of course

It was now, as Sir Austin had written
it down, The Magnetic Age

It is no use trying to conceal anything
from him

It's a fool that hopes for peace
anywhere

It's no use trying to be a gentleman if
you can't pay for it

Italians were like women, and wanted--a
real beating

Its glee at a catastrophe; its poor
stock of mercy

January was watering and freezing old
earth by turns

Judging of the destiny of man by the
fate of individuals

Just bad inquirin' too close among men

Keep passion sober, a trotter in
harness

Kelts, as they are called, can't and
won't forgive injuries

Kindness is kindness, all over the
world

Knew my friend to be one of the most
absent-minded of men

Lack of precise words admonished him of
the virtue of silence

Land and beasts!  They sound like
blessed things

Lawyers hold the keys of the great
world

Lay no petty traps for opportunity

Laying of ghosts is a public duty

Leader accustomed to count ahead upon
vapourish abstractions

Learn all about them afterwards, ay,
and make the best of them

Learn--principally not to be afraid of
ideas

Led him to impress his unchangeableness
upon her

Lend him your own generosity

Lengthened term of peace bred maggots
in the heads of the people

Lest thou commence to lie--be dumb!

Let but the throb be kept for others--
That is the one secret

Let never Necessity draw the bow of our
weakness

Let none of us be so exalted above the
wit of daily life

Levelling a finger at the taxpayer

Lies are usurers' coin we pay for ten
thousand per cent

Life is the burlesque of young dreams

Like a woman, who would and would not,
and wanted a master

Like an ill-reared fruit, first at the
core it rotteth

Limit was two bottles of port wine at a
sitting

Listened to one another, and blinded
the world

Literature is a good stick and a bad
horse

Little boy named Tommy Wedger said he
saw a dead body go by

Littlenesses of which women are accused

Loathing of artifice to raise emotion

Loathing for speculation

Longing for love and dependence

Look within, and avoid lying

Look well behind

Look backward only to correct an error
of conduct in future

Looked as proud as if he had just
clapped down the full amount

Looking on him was listening

Loudness of the interrogation precluded
thought of an answer

Love, with his accustomed cunning

Love the poor devil

Love dies like natural decay

Love the children of Erin, when not
fretted by them

Love of men and women as a toy that I
have played with

Love of pleasure keeps us blind
children

Love and war have been compared--Both
require strategy

Love that shrieks at a mortal wound,
and bleeds humanly

Love discerns unerringly what is and
what is not duty

Love must needs be an egoism

Love is a contagious disease

Love the difficulty better than the
woman

Love, that has risen above emotion,
quite independent of craving

Love's a selfish business one has work
in hand

Loves his poets, can almost understand
what poetry means

Loving in this land: they all go mad,
straight off

Lucky accidents are anticipated only by
fools

Made of his creed a strait-jacket for
humanity

Madness that sane men enamoured can be
struck by

Magnificent in generosity; he had
little humaneness

Magnify an offence in the ratio of our
vanity

Make no effort to amuse him.  He is
always occupied

Make a girl  drink her tears, if they
ain't to be let fall

Making too much of it--a trick of the
vulgar

Man with a material object in aim, is
the man of his object

Man who beats his wife my first
question is, 'Do he take his tea?'

Man owes a duty to his class

Man who helps me to read the world and
men as they are

Man without a penny in his pocket, and
a gizzard full of pride

Mankind is offended by heterodoxy in
mean attire

Mare would do, and better than a dozen
horses

Mark of a fool to take everybody for a
bigger fool than himself

Marriage is an awful thing, where
there's no love

Married at forty, and I had to take her
shaped as she was

Married a wealthy manufacturer--
bartered her blood for his money

Martyrs of love or religion are madmen

Material good reverses its benefits the
more nearly we clasp it

Matter that is not nourishing to brains

Maxims of her own on the subject of
rising and getting the worm

May lull themselves with their
wakefulness

May not one love, not craving to be
beloved?

Meant to vanquish her with the
dominating patience

Meditations upon the errors of the
general man, as a cover

Memory inspired by the sensations

Men overweeningly in love with their
creations

Men do not play truant from home at
sixty years of age

Men they regard as their natural prey

Men bore the blame, though the women
were rightly punished

Men must fight: the law is only a
quieter field for them

Men in love are children with their
mistresses

Men love to boast of things nobody else
has seen

Men who believe that there is a virtue
in imprecations

Men had not pleased him of late

Mistake of the world is to think
happiness possible to the sense

Mistaking of her desires for her
reasons

Modest are the most easily intoxicated

Money is of course a rough test of
virtue

Money's a chain-cable for holding men

Moral indignation is ever consolatory

Morales, madame, suit ze sun

More argument I cannot bear

More culpable the sparer than the

Mrs. Fleming, of Queen Anne's Farm, was

Music was resumed to confuse the

Music in Italy?  Amorous and martial,

Mutual deference

My engagement to Mr. Pericles is that I
am not to write

My mistress!  My glorious stolen fruit!
My dark angel of love

Nature and Law never agreed

Nature is not of necessity always
roaring

Nature could at a push be eloquent to
defend the guilty

Nature's logic, Nature's voice, for
self-defence

Naughtily Australian and kangarooly

Necessary for him to denounce somebody

Necessity's offspring

Needed support of facts, and feared
them

Never reckon on womankind for a wise
act

Never, never love a married woman

Never intended that we should play with
flesh and blood

Never forget that old Ireland is
weeping

Never forgave an injury without a
return blow for it

Never to despise the good opinion of
the nonentities

Never nurse an injury, great or small

Never was a word fitter for a quack's
mouth than "humanity"

Never fell far short of outstripping
the sturdy pedestrian Time

Never pretend to know a girl by her
face

Nevertheless, inclinations are an
infidelity

Next door to the Last Trump

Night has little mercy for the
self-reproachful

No nose to the hero, no moral to the
tale

No runner can outstrip his fate

No companionship save with the wound
they nurse

No Act to compel a man to deny what
appears in the papers

No great harm done when you're silent

No heart to dare is no heart to love!

No stopping the Press while the people
have an appetite for it

No word is more lightly spoken than
shame

No flattery for me at the expense of my
sisters

No man has a firm foothold who pretends
to it

No enemy's shot is equal to a weak
heart in the act

No man can hear the words which prove
him a prophet (quietly)

No conversation coming of it, her
curiosity was violent

No intoxication of hot blood to cheer
those who sat at home

No case is hopeless till a man consents
to think it is

No love can be without jealousy

No! Gentlemen don't fling stones; leave
that to the blackguards

None but fanatics, cowards,
white-eyeballed dogmatists

Nor can a protest against coarseness be
sweepingly interpreted

Not every chapter can be sunshine

Not afford to lose, and a disposition
free of the craving to win

Not men of brains, but the men of
aptitudes

Not the indignant and the frozen, but
the genially indifferent

Not daring risk of office by offending
the taxpayer

Not in love--She was only not unwilling
to be in love

Not a page of his books reveals
malevolence or a sneer

Not always the right thing to do the
right thing

Not to do things wholly is worse than
not to do things at all

Not to be feared more than are the
general race of bunglers

Not much esteem for non-professional
actresses

Not in a situation that could bear of
her blaming herself

Not so much read a print as read the
imprinting on themselves

Things are not equal

Things were lumpish and gloomy that day
of the week

Thirst for the haranguing of crowds

This was a totally different case from
the antecedent ones

This mania of young people for
pleasure, eternal pleasure

This love they rattle about and rave
about

This girl was pliable only to service,
not to grief

This female talk of the eternities

Those happy men who enjoy perceptions
without opinions

Those who know little and dread much

Those days of intellectual coxcombry

Those numerous women who always know
themselves to be right

Time and strength run to waste in
retarding the inevitable

Time is due to us, and the minutes are
our gold slipping away

Time, whose trick is to turn corners of
unanticipated sharpness

Times when an example is needed by
brave men

Tis the fashion to have our tattle done
by machinery

Tis the first step that makes a path

Titles showered on the women who take
free breath of air

To be a really popular hero anywhere in
Britain (must be a drinker)

To hope, and not be impatient, is
really to believe

To males, all ideas are female until
they are made facts

To be both generally blamed, and

To let people speak was a maxim of Mrs.
Mel's, and a wise one

To kill the deer and be sorry for the
suffering wretch is common

To be passive in calamity is the
province of no woman

To the rest of the world he was a
progressive comedy

To know how to take a licking, that
wins in the end

To have no sympathy with the playful
mind is not to have a mind

To time and a wife it is no disgrace
for a man to bend

To know that you are in England,
breathing the same air with me

To be her master, however, one must not
begin by writhing as her slave

To do nothing, is the wisdom of those
who have seen fools perish

To most men women are knaves or ninnies

To beg the vote and wink the bribe

Tongue flew, thought followed

Too well used to defeat to believe
readily in victory

Too prompt, too full of personal relish
of his point

Too many time-servers rot the State

Too weak to resist, to submit to an
outrage quietly

Too often hangs the house on one loose
stone

Took care to be late, so that all eyes
beheld her

Tooth that received a stone when it
expected candy

Top and bottom sin is cowardice

Tossed him from repulsion to
incredulity, and so back

Touch him with my hand, before he
passed from our sight

Touch sin and you accommodate yourself
to its vileness

Touching a nerve

Toyed with little flowers of palest
memory

Tradesman, and he never was known to
have sent in a bill

Trial of her beauty of a woman in a
temper

Trick for killing time without hurting
him

Tried  to be honest, and was as much so
as his disease permitted

Troublesome appendages of success

True love excludes no natural duty

True enjoyment of the princely
disposition

Trust no man  Still, this man may be
better than that man

Truth is, they have taken a stain from
the life they lead

Twice a bad thing to turn sinners loose

Twisted by a nature that would not
allow of open eyes

Two wishes make a will

Two principal roads by which poor
sinners come to a conscience

Two people love, there is no such thing
as owing between them

Unaccustomed to have his will thwarted

Unanimous verdicts from a jury of
temporary impressions

Uncommon unprogressiveness

Unfeminine of any woman to speak
continuously anywhere

Universal censor's angry spite

Unseemly hour--unbetimes

Unshamed exuberant male has found the
sweet reverse in his mate

Use your religion like a drug

Utterance of generous and patriotic
cries is not sufficient

Vagrant compassionateness of
sentimentalists

Vanity maketh the strongest most weak

Venerated by his followers, well hated
by his enemies

Venus of nature was melting into a
Venus of art

Very little parleying between
determined men

Vessel was conspiring to ruin our
self-respect

Victims of the modern feminine 'ideal'

Violent summons to accept, which is a
provocation to deny

Virtue of impatience

Virtuously zealous in an instant on
behalf of the lovely dame

Vowed never more to repeat that offence
to his patience

Vulgarity in others evoked vulgarity in
her

Wait till the day's ended before you
curse your luck

Waited serenely for the certain
disasters to enthrone her

Wakening to the claims of others--
Youth's infant conscience

Want of courage is want of sense

War is only an exaggerated form of
duelling

Warm, is hardly the word--Winter's warm
on skates

Was I true?  Not so very false, yet how
far from truth!

Was not one of the order whose Muse is
the Public Taste

Was born on a hired bed

Watch, and wait

We are, in short, a civilized people

We shall not be rich--nor poor

We could row and ride and fish and
shoot, and breed largely

We has long overshadowed "I"

We are good friends till we quarrel
again

We are chiefly led by hope

We have a system, not planned but grown

We can bear to fall; we cannot afford
to draw back

We can't hope to have what should be

We don't know we are in halves

We must fawn in society

We never see peace but in the features
of the dead

We live alone, and do not much feel it
till we are visited

We dare not be weak if we would

We do not see clearly when we are
trying to deceive

We women can read men by their power to
love

We were unarmed, and the spectacle was
distressing

We trust them or we crush them

We shall go together; we shall not have
to weep for one another

We make our taskmasters of those to
whom we have done a wrong

We cannot relinquish an idea that was
ours

We deprive all renegades of their
spiritual titles

We like well whatso we have done good
work for

We grew accustomed to periods of Irish
fever

We have come to think we have a claim
upon her gratitude

We must have some excuse, if we would
keep to life

We shall want a war to teach the
country the value of courage

We cannot, men or woman, control the
heart in sleep at night

We have now looked into the hazy
interior of their systems

We don't go together into a garden of
roses

We're treated like old-fashioned
ornaments!

We're all of us hit at last, and
generally by our own weapon

We're a peaceful people, but 'ware who
touches us

We're smitten to-day in our hearts and
our pockets

We've all a parlous lot too much pulpit
in us

Weak stomach is certainly more carnally
virtuous than a full one

Weak reeds who are easily vanquished
and never overcome

Weak souls are much moved by having the
pathos on their side

Weather and women have some resemblance
they say

Weighty little word--woman's native
watchdog and guardian (No!)

Welcomed and lured on an adversary to
wild outhitting

Well, sir, we must sell our opium

Welsh blood is queer blood

Went into endless invalid's laughter

Were I chained, For liberty I would
sell liberty

What might have been

What the world says, is what the wind
says

What will be thought of me? not a small
matter to any of us

What he did, she took among other
inevitable matters

What a stock of axioms young people
have handy

What a woman thinks of women, is the
test of her nature

What else is so consolatory to a ruined
man?

What was this tale of Emilia, that grew
more and more perplexing

What ninnies call Nature in books

What a man hates in adversity is to see
'faces'

What's an eccentric?  a child grown
grey!

When you run away, you don't live to
fight another day

When we see our veterans tottering to
their fall

When to loquacious fools with patience
rare I listen

When testy old gentlemen could commit
slaughter with ecstasy

When he's a Christian instead of a
Churchman

When Love is hurt, it is self-love that
requires the opiate

When duelling flourished on our land,
frail women powerful

When we despair or discolour things, it
is our senses in revolt

When you have done laughing with her,
you can laugh at her

Where fools are the fathers of every
miracle

Where one won't and can't, poor
t' other must

Where she appears, the first person
falls to second rank

Where heart weds mind, or nature joins
intellect

Where love exists there is goodness

Whimpering fits you said we enjoy and
must have in books

Who venerate when they love

Who cannot talk!--but who can?

Who rises from Prayer a better man, his
prayer is answered

Who beguiles so much as Self?

Who shrinks from an hour that is
suspended in doubt

Who in a labyrinth wandereth without
clue

Who enjoyed simple things when
commanding the luxuries

Who can really think, and not think
hopefully?

Who cries, Come on, and prays his gods
you won't

Who so intoxicated as the convalescent
catching at health?

Who shuns true friends flies fortune in
the concrete

Who ever loved that loved not at first
sight?

Whole body of fanatics combined to
precipitate the devotion

Whose bounty was worse to him than his
abuse

Why should these men take so much
killing?

Why, he'll snap your head off for a
word

Why he enjoyed the privilege of seeing,
and was not beside her

Wife and no wife, a prisoner in liberty

Wilfrid perceived that he had become an
old man

Will not admit the existence of a
virtue in an opposite opinion

William John Fleming was simply a poor
farmer

Win you--temperately, let us hope; by
storm, if need be

Winds of panic are violently engaged in
occupying the vacuum

Wins everywhere back a reflection of
its own kindliness

Winter mornings are divine.  They move
on noiselessly

Wise in not seeking to be too wise

With that I sail into the dark

With good wine to wash it down, one can
swallow anything

With what little wisdom the world is
governed

With death; we'd rather not, because of
a qualm

With one idea, we see nothing--nothing
but itself

With a frozen fish of admirable
principles for wife

With this money, said the demon,  you
might speculate

With a proud humility

Withdrew into the entrenchments of
contempt

Without a single intimation that he
loathed the task

Without those consolatory efforts,
useless between men

Wits, which are ordinarily less
productive than land

Wives are only an item in the list, and
not the most important

Woman descending from her ideal to the
gross reality of man

Woman will be the last thing civilized
by Man

Woman finds herself on board a
rudderless vessel

Woman's precious word No at the
sentinel's post, and alert

Women are wonderfully quick scholars
under ridicule

Women with brains, moreover, are all
heartless

Women are taken to be the second
thoughts of the Creator

Women don't care uncommonly for the men
who love them

Women must not be judging things out of
their sphere

Women and men are in two hostile camps

Women treat men as their tamed
housemates

Women are swift at coming to
conclusions in these matters

Women are happier enslaved

Won't do to be taking in reefs on a
lee-shore

Wonderment that one of her sex should
have ideas

Wooing her with dog's eyes instead of
words

Wooing a good man for his friendship

Work of extravagance upon perceptibly
plain matter

Work is medicine

World cannot pardon a breach of
continuity

World against us  It will not keep us
from trying to serve

World is ruthless, dear friends,
because the world is hypocrite

World prefers decorum to honesty

World voluntarily opens a path to those
who step determinedly

Would like to feel he was doing a bit
of good

Would he see what he aims at?  let him
ask his heels

Wrapped in the comfort of his cowardice

Writer society delights in, to show
what it is composed of

Yawns coming alarmingly fast, in the
place of ideas

Years are the teachers of the great
rocky natures

Yet, though Angels smile, shall not
Devils laugh

You accuse or you exonerate--Nobody can
be half guilty

You choose to give yourself to an
obscure dog

You rides when you can, and you walks
when you must

You talk your mother with a vengeance

You do want polish

You who may have cared for her through
her many tribulations, have no fear

You are entreated to repress alarm

You beat me with the fists, but my
spirit is towering

You can master pain, but not doubt

You are not married, you are simply
chained

You have not to be told that I desire
your happiness above all

You are to imagine that they know
everything

You may learn to know yourself through
love

You want me to flick your indecision

You saw nothing but handkerchiefs out
all over the theatre

You played for gain, and that was a
licenced thieving

You'll have to guess at half of
everything he tells you

You'll tell her you couldn't sit down
in her presence undressed

You're the puppet of your women!

You're talking to me, not to a gallery

You're a rank, right-down widow, and no
mistake

You're going to be men, meaning
something better than women

You've got no friend but your bed

Young as when she looked upon the
lovers in Paradise

Your devotion craves an enormous
exchange

Youth will not believe that stupidity
and beauty can go together

Youth is not alarmed by the sound of
big sums

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
