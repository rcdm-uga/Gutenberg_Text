unsaid

evil is not absolute

She valued what others found useless

Should not make our own personal
experience a law unto the world

Shure, if we could always be 'about the
same,' we'd do

Simply to have death renewed every
morning

Slander ever scorches where it touches

Slow-footed hours wandered by, leaving
apathy in their train

Smiling was part of his equipment

So say your prayers, believe all you
can, don't ask questions

Solitude fixes our hearts immovably on
things

Some people are rough with the
poor--and proud

Some wise men are fools, one way or
another

Some are hurt in one way and some in
another

Sometimes the longest way round is the
shortest way home

Soul tortured through different degrees
of misunderstanding

Spurting out little geysers of other
people's cheap wisdom

Still the end of your existence, I
rejoined--to be amused?

Strike first and heal after--"a kick
and a lick"

Struggle of conscience and expediency

Surely she might weep a little for
herself

Suspicion, the bane of sick old age

Sympathy, with curiousness in their
eyes and as much inhumanity

Sympathy and consolation might be much
misplaced

Thanked him in her heart for the things
he had left unsaid

That anxious civility which beauty can
inspire

That iceberg which most mourners carry
in their breasts

That he will find the room empty where
I am not

The Government cherish the Injin much
in these days

The Injin speaks the truth,
perhaps--eye of red man multiplies

The blind tyranny of the just

The soul of goodness in things evil

The higher we go the faster we live

The gods made last to humble the pride
of men--there was rum

The world never welcomes its deserters

The furious music of death and war was
over

The tender care of a woman--than many
pharmacopoeias

The beginning of the end of things was
come for him

The ravings of a sick man are not
always counted ravings

The friendship of man is like the shade
of the acacia

The sea is a great breeder of
friendship

The vague pain of suffered indifference

The soul is a great traveller

The happy scene of the play before the
villain comes in

The threshold of an acknowledged love

The Barracks of the Free

The real business of life is trying to
understand each other

The world is not so bad as is claimed
for it

The temerity and nonchalance of despair

There is nothing so tragic as the
formal

There are things we repent of which
cannot be repaired

There is something humiliating in even
an undeserved injury

There should be written the one word,
"Wait"

There is no refuge from memory and
remorse in this world

There was never a grey wind but there's
a greyer

There is no influence like the
influence of habit

There is no habit so powerful as the
habit of care of others

There's no credit in not doing what you
don't want to do

These little pieces of art make life
possible

They think that if a vote's worth
having it's worth paying for

They whose tragedy lies in the capacity
to suffer greatly

Things in life git stronger than we are

Things that once charmed charm less

Think with the minds of twelve men, and
the heart of one woman

Think that a woman gives the heart for
pleasant weather only?

Think of our position

Thou wouldst not think how ill all's
here about my heart

Time when she should and when she
should not be wooed

Time is the test, and Time will have
its way with me

Time a woman most yearns for a man is
when she has refused him

To die without whining

To be popular is not necessarily to be
contemptible

To sorrow may their humour be a foil

To-morrow is no man's gift

Touch of the fantastic, of the
barbaric, in all genius

Training in the charms of
superficiality

Tricks played by Fact to discredit the
imagination

Triumph of Oriental duplicity over
Western civilisation

Truth waits long, but whips hard

Tyranny of the little man, given a
power

Undisciplined generosity

Untamed by the normal restraints of a
happy married life

Uses up your misery and makes you tired
(Work)

Vanity is the bane of mankind

Vanity of successful labour

Vanity; and from this much feminine
hatred springs

Very severe on those who do not pretend
to be good

Visions of the artistic
temperament--delight and curse

War is cruelty, and none can make it
gentle

Was not civilisation a mistake

We don't live in months and years, but
just in minutes

We want to get more out of life than
there really is in it

We want every land to do as we do; and
we want to make 'em do it

We grow away from people against our
will

We are only children till we begin to
make our dreams our life

We care so little for real justice

We do what we forbid ourselves to do

We suffer the shames we damn in others

We must live our dark hours alone

We speak with the straight tongue; it
is cowards who lie

We'll lave the past behind us

What fools there are in the world

What is gone is gone.  Graves are
idolatry

What is crime in one country, is virtue
in another

What a nice mob you press fellows
are--wholesale scavengers

What'll be the differ a hundred years
from now

Whatever has been was a dream; whatever
is now is real

When a child is born the mother also is
born again

When you strike your camp, put out the
fires

When God permits, shall man despair?

When a man laugh in the sun and think
nothing of evil

Where the light is darkness

Where I should never hear the voice of
the social Thou must

Who knows!

Who can understand a woman?

Who get a morbid enjoyment out of
misery

Who say 'God bless you' in New York!
They say 'Damn you!'

Who never knew self-consciousness

Wit is always at the elbow of want

Without the money brains seldom win
alone

Woman's deepest right and joy and pain
in one--to comfort

Women only admitted to Heaven by the
intercession of husbands

Women are half saints, half fools

Women may leave you in the bright days

Women don't go by evidence, but by
their feelings

World was only the size of four walls
to a sick person

Worth while to have lived so long and
to have seen so much

Would look back and not remember that
she had a childhood

You went north towards heaven and south
towards hell

You have lost your illusions

You never can really overtake a
newspaper lie

You can't take time as the measure of
life

You cannot live long enough to atone
for that impertinence

You do not shout dinner till you have
your knife in the loaf

You never can make a scandal less by
trying to hide it

You've got blind rashness, and so you
think you're bold

You've got to be ready, that's all

You--you all were so ready to suspect

Youth hungers for the vanities

Youth is the only comrade for youth

Youth's a dream, middle age a delusion,
old age a mistake

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
